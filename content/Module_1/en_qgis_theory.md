# What is GIS?

At its core, GIS is a computer-based system to organise data with a spatial 
component (_geodata_). There are three core functions of GIS:

1. Connecting data to maps  
2. Visualisation, organisation and processing of spatial data  
3. Analysing spatial

In humanitarian work, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) serve as powerful tools. They utilize maps to present complex information clearly and efficiently. For instance, during emergencies, GIS can visualize events on a map, depicting where they occur, the extent of impact, and identifying primary needs. It aids in consolidating data from various sources, enabling quick comprehension of situations and facilitating better decision-making.

__A more formal definition:__

A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a digital tool that integrates data with maps. It enables the collection, management, analysis, and visualization of data by associating them with specific locations on the Earth's surface. By leveraging GIS, we gain deeper insights into data, revealing patterns and providing a better understanding of the geographic context. This leads to more insightful analysis, improved communication, and ultimately facilitates better evidence-based decision-making. GIS is deeply rooted in geography, the scientific field dedicated to studying Earth's lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena. GIS software is capable of displaying various types of data simultaneously on a map, enhancing our ability to comprehend complex spatial relationships.

## GIS components

GIS is more than a software. It’s a system and it includes

## GIS vs cartography

__Cartography__ is the art and science of creating maps, encompassing the study and practice of mapmaking techniques. A Geographic Information System (GIS) represents a __modern evolution__ of traditional cartography, integrating advanced technologies and methods for spatial data analysis and visualization.

While both cartography and GIS involve the creation of maps, they differ significantly in their capabilities and approaches. Cartographic maps typically present a simplified representation of geographic features, constrained by the limitations of physical space and the medium of the map itself. In contrast, GIS allows for the integration of vast amounts of spatial data, enabling complex analysis, modeling, and visualization beyond the scope of traditional cartography.

One key distinction is that GIS facilitates the incorporation of diverse datasets, with virtually unlimited capacity for __additional layers and information__. This flexibility empowers users to conduct __spatial analysis, perform statistical assessments__, and derive insights to support decision-making processes.

In essence, while cartography focuses primarily on map design and visualization, GIS extends beyond to encompass spatial data management, analysis, and interpretation. Therefore, GIS serves as a powerful tool for cartographers and professionals across various fields to create, analyze, and derive insights from geographic information

## What is spatial analysis?

Many map products rely on spatial analysis. And indeed, the ability to use analysis tools allows us to get the most out of the data we have and to solve a wide variety of problems. The points below give you an simple definition of the concept.

However, the example of John Snow's cholera map of 1854 is a popular example of how spatial analysis can help to solve problems. 

- Spatial analysis __studies entities and events__ using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties. 
- It includes a __variety of techniques__ to analyse geographic data. 
- Data can be __added to a map as layers and they can interact with each other__. 
- GIS enables you to work with these __layers__ to explore critically important questions and __find answers__ to those questions.


### An example from the past: John Snow's cholera map

In 1854, an __outbreak of cholera__ occurred in the Soho area of London, England. The most common theory was that the disease was spread through the air. Dr. John Snow believed that the danger was __in the water__. He made a map to analyse the __number of deaths__ in every housing block in Soho. He added the __location of water pumps__ on the map. He found a __correlation__ between one specific water pump and the number of infections.

__Dr. Snow's map of the cholera outbreak of 1854__ ({numref}`John_snow_zoom_map2`), and the reports that it accompanied, __won over the predominant "miasma theory"__ that the disease __was spread through the air__. Residents were now warned to __boil their water__, and so ended the last cholera outbreak London has seen.

This interactive version of the cholera map shows it overlaid on a basemap of modern London.

__Using GIS__, several measures of spatial central tendency have been applied to the dataset, revealing that the Spatial Mean (the geographic center of the distribution of deaths) of the outbreak lies __within 35 meters of the Broad Street Pump__, identified as the __source of contamination__ in the 1854 outbreak.

## Common map types in humanitarian response

:::{note}

The humanitarian sector tends to use certain types of maps regularly. These areoutlined below. 

:::

### General reference maps

-  Show important __physical features__ of an area
-  Include __natural and man-made features__
-  Usually meant to help for __navigation__ or discovery of locations
-  Usually fairly __simple__
-  Can be __styled__ based on the intended audience

### Infrastructure maps

Infrastructure maps in the humanitarian context provide visual representations of critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, hospitals, and utilities in a given area. These maps help humanitarian organizations assess the accessibility of affected areas, plan relief efforts, and coordinate resources effectively during emergencies or disasters.

 - Display relevant features and __structures__ in a specific area
 - Help __planning__ and navigation
 - High level of __detail__
 - Produced after field __data collection__

:::

### Thematic maps

Thematic maps display specific themes or topics such as population density, disease outbreaks, or vulnerability levels within a geographic area. These maps help humanitarian organizations analyze and understand specific issues or trends, guiding decision-making and resource allocation for targeted interventions and relief efforts.

- Focus on a __specific theme__ or subject
- Features on the map __represent the subject__ being mapped
- Use __colours and shapes__ to display quantitative and qualitative data
- Rise __awareness__ about a specific subject

### Analysis maps

Analysis maps are used to examine and interpret data, revealing patterns, trends, and relationships within a geographic area. They facilitate in-depth understanding of complex situations, enabling decision-makers to derive insights and make informed decisions for effective humanitarian responses.

- __Analyse data__ in respect to their geographic location
- Create __new layers of information__ from the interaction between multiple features
- Use colours and shapes __to help users__ understand specific events
- __Support__ decision makers
- Generally display a greater __level of detail__

## Self-Assessment Questions

:::::{admonition} Test your knowledge
:class: note

Take a moment to reflect on what you've learned in this module. The questions below are designed to help you check your understanding of key concepts and identify areas you may want to review further. You don't need to submit your answers — this is for your own learning.

1. __What are the three core functions of GIS?__  

:::{dropdown} Answer
GIS (Geographic Information System) is a system for capturing, manipulating, analysing, and visualising spatial data. The three core functions are:
  - __Data Capture__: creating (or digitising) spatial data.
  - __Analysis__: performing analyses or processing spatial data to gain insights or knowledge.
  - __Visualisation__: Visualising spatial data on maps, charts, or reports to communicate information
:::

2. __What is spatial analysis and how did John Snow use spatial analysis in his cholera outbreak map from 1854?__  

:::{dropdown} Answer
Spatial analysis is the process of examining geographic (spatial) data to detect patterns, relationships, trends, and spatial structures. It involves operations like overlay, buffering, proximity, clustering, interpolation, and assessing how phenomena vary across space.

In 1854, Dr. John Snow mapped the locations of cholera deaths in London (Soho district) alongside the locations of water pumps. He noticed that the cholera cases clustered around one particular pump (on Broad Street). Because there was a spatial clustering around that pump, he hypothesized that the water from that pump was the source of the outbreak. He then convinced authorities to remove the pump handle, after which the outbreak declined. In effect, he used spatial distribution and clustering of disease incidents to infer a causal relationship. (This is a classic early example of applying spatial analysis in epidemiology.)His map showed that the deaths were not randomly distributed but spatially concentrated around a water source, which is the essence of spatial reasoning.

3. __Name the five common map types used in humanitarian work.__  

:::{dropdown} Answer
1. General Reference Maps: Show general geographic features like roads, rivers, and administrative boundaries; used for navigation and orientation.
2. Infrastructure Maps: Thematic maps focused on physical infrastructure (e.g., hospitals, water points, roads); used for planning and logistics.
3. Thematic Maps: Represent a specific theme or dataset (e.g., population, rainfall, conflict); uses color, shapes, or symbols to visualize non-spatial attributes.
4. Analysis Maps: Result from spatial analysis to guide decision-making (e.g., hazard risk zones, suitability models).
5. Situation Maps: Provide an overview of a humanitarian or emergency situation; show affected areas, operational activities, or needs assessments.
