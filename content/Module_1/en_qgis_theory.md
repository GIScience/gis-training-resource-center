# What is GIS?

At its core, GIS is a computer-based system to organise data with a spatial 
component (_geodata_). There are three core functions of GIS:

1. Connecting data to maps  
2. Visualisation, organisation and processing of spatial data  
3. Analysing spatial

In humanitarian work, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) serve as powerful tools. They utilize maps to present complex information clearly and efficiently. For instance, during emergencies, GIS can visualize events on a map, depicting where they occur, the extent of impact, and identifying primary needs. It aids in consolidating data from various sources, enabling quick comprehension of situations and facilitating better decision-making.

__A more formal definition:__

A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a digital tool that integrates data with maps. It enables the collection, management, analysis, and visualization of data by associating them with specific locations on the Earth's surface. By leveraging GIS, we gain deeper insights into data, revealing patterns and providing a better understanding of the geographic context. This leads to more insightful analysis, improved communication, and ultimately facilitates better evidence-based decision-making. GIS is deeply rooted in geography, the scientific field dedicated to studying Earth's lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena. GIS software is capable of displaying various types of data simultaneously on a map, enhancing our ability to comprehend complex spatial relationships.

## GIS components

GIS is more than a software. It’s a system and it includes
multiple elements:

## GIS vs cartography

__Cartography__ is the art and science of creating maps, encompassing the study and practice of mapmaking techniques. A Geographic Information System (GIS) represents a __modern evolution__ of traditional cartography, integrating advanced technologies and methods for spatial data analysis and visualization.

While both cartography and GIS involve the creation of maps, they differ significantly in their capabilities and approaches. Cartographic maps typically present a simplified representation of geographic features, constrained by the limitations of physical space and the medium of the map itself. In contrast, GIS allows for the integration of vast amounts of spatial data, enabling complex analysis, modeling, and visualization beyond the scope of traditional cartography.

One key distinction is that GIS facilitates the incorporation of diverse datasets, with virtually unlimited capacity for __additional layers and information__. This flexibility empowers users to conduct __spatial analysis, perform statistical assessments__, and derive insights to support decision-making processes.

In essence, while cartography focuses primarily on map design and visualization, GIS extends beyond to encompass spatial data management, analysis, and interpretation. Therefore, GIS serves as a powerful tool for cartographers and professionals across various fields to create, analyze, and derive insights from geographic information

## What is spatial analysis?

Many map products rely on spatial analysis. And indeed, the ability to use 
analysis tools allows us to get the most out of the data we have and to solve a 
wide variety of problems. The points below give you an simple definition of the 
concept.

However, the example of John Snow's cholera map of 1854 is a popular example of 
how spatial analysis can help to solve problems. 

- Spatial analysis __studies entities and events__ using their topological, 
  geometric, or geographic properties. 
- It includes a __variety of techniques__ to analyse geographic data. 
- Data can be __added to a map as layers and they can interact with each other__. 
- GIS enables you to work with these __layers__ to explore critically important 
  questions and __find answers__ to those questions.


### An example from the past: John Snow's cholera map

In 1854, an __outbreak of cholera__ occurred in the Soho area of London, England. 
The most common theory was that the disease was spread through the air. 
Dr. John Snow believed that the danger was __in the water__. He made a map to 
analyse the __number of deaths__ in every housing block in Soho. He added the 
__location of water pumps__ on the map. He found a __correlation__ between one 
specific water pump and the number of infections.

__Dr. Snow's map of the cholera outbreak of 1854__ ({numref}`John_snow_zoom_map2`), and the reports that it 
accompanied, __won over the predominant "miasma theory"__ that the disease __was 
spread through the air__. Residents were now warned to __boil their water__, and 
so ended the last cholera outbreak London has seen.

This interactive version of the cholera map shows it overlaid on a basemap of 
modern London.

```

__Using GIS__, several measures of spatial central tendency have been applied to 
the dataset, revealing that the Spatial Mean (the geographic center of the 
distribution of deaths) of the outbreak lies __within 35 meters of the Broad 
Street Pump__, identified as the __source of contamination__ in the 1854 outbreak.

## Common map types in humanitarian response

:::{note}

The humanitarian sector tends to use certain types of maps regularly. These are
outlined below. 

:::

### General reference maps

-  Show important __physical features__ of an area
-  Include __natural and man-made features__
-  Usually meant to help for __navigation__ or discovery of locations
-  Usually fairly __simple__
-  Can be __styled__ based on the intended audience

```

### Infrastructure maps

Infrastructure maps in the humanitarian context provide visual representations of critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, hospitals, and utilities in a given area. These maps help humanitarian organizations assess the accessibility of affected areas, plan relief efforts, and coordinate resources effectively during emergencies or disasters.

 - Display relevant features and __structures__ in a specific area
 - Help __planning__ and navigation
 - High level of __detail__
 - Produced after field __data collection__

```

### Thematic maps

Thematic maps display specific themes or topics such as population density, disease outbreaks, or vulnerability levels within a geographic area. These maps help humanitarian organizations analyze and understand specific issues or trends, guiding decision-making and resource allocation for targeted interventions and relief efforts.

- Focus on a __specific theme__ or subject
- Features on the map __represent the subject__ being mapped
- Use __colours and shapes__ to display quantitative and qualitative data
- Rise __awareness__ about a specific subject

```

### Analysis maps

Analysis maps are used to examine and interpret data, revealing patterns, trends, and relationships within a geographic area. They facilitate in-depth understanding of complex situations, enabling decision-makers to derive insights and make informed decisions for effective humanitarian responses.

- __Analyse data__ in respect to their geographic location
- Create __new layers of information__ from the interaction between multiple features
- Use colours and shapes __to help users__ understand specific events
- __Support__ decision makers
- Generally display a greater __level of detail__

```

### Situation/descriptive maps

Situation or descriptive maps provide a snapshot of specific conditions or events in a particular geographic area. They visualize key information such as locations of resources, population distribution, infrastructure, and environmental factors. These maps offer a clear overview of the current situation, aiding in understanding and communication among stakeholders involved in humanitarian operations.

- Used to __better visualize__ a specific ongoing and/or past situation 
- Maps can include __narrative__ and graphic elements 
- Can be used in reports and/or to __raise awareness__ on a specific event
