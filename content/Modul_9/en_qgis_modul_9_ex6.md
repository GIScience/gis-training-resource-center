# Task 6: West Germany / Ahrtal flood logistics

While exploring the general functionality of the ORS plugin, we will specifically focus on its application in disaster-aware routing. To demonstrate its practical use, we will dive into the scenario of the devastating Ahr Valley flood that occurred in Germany in 2021. By leveraging the plugin's capabilities, we will learn how to optimize routing decisions in the context of disaster response and recovery.

By the end of this workshop, you will have gained valuable insights and practical skills in using the ORS plugin for QGIS, empowering you to make informed routing decisions and contribute to more efficient disaster management efforts. Let's embark on this journey of exploring disaster-aware routing with the ORS plugin and QGIS!

## PART 1 - Single routes with ORS Tools

### STEP 1: Creating a Simple Route using the ORS Tools Plugin in QGIS

In this first task, we will focus on creating a single, straightforward route using the ORS Tools plugin within the QGIS software. Your objective is to define an origin/source and a destination, and utilize the plugin to generate a route between these two points. To get started, you can choose N√ºrburgring in Germany as the source location since it served as the staging area for disaster relief during the emergency response. For the destination, you can select Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, the largest city affected by the Ahr Valley flood.

To accomplish this task, refer to the available resources provided above to familiarize yourself with the functionality and features of the ORS Tools plugin. Explore the plugin's interface, study the options available, and apply the necessary settings to successfully generate the desired route. Feel free to experiment and troubleshoot any challenges you may encounter along the way.

By completing this task, you will gain a solid understanding of how to leverage the ORS Tools plugin in QGIS to create simple routes, setting the foundation for more advanced applications in subsequent exercises. Good luck, and enjoy the learning process!

You have two options to create directions with ORS Tools plugin. Either via the `Directions` Tool. After installing the plugin you'll find new entries in your _Processing Toolbox_ in the section `ORS Tools`. There you find tools on `Directions`, `Isochrones` and `Matrix`. But you can also use the ORS Tools Window, open it via the top navigation _Web_ --> _ORS Tools_ --> _ORS Tools_. There you can control your origin and destination for the route via the green plus button. You then choose the points from your QGIS map canvas. Via the apply button, a route is calculated.

### STEP 2: Incorporating Avoid Areas into the Route using the ORS Tools Plugin in QGIS

In this second task, we will build upon the knowledge gained from the previous exercise and introduce the concept of avoid areas in route planning using the ORS Tools plugin in QGIS. Your objective is to repeat the workflow of creating a route between the N√ºrburgring and Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler, but this time, you will add specific areas that should be avoided along the route.

To accomplish this, you will need to create a temporary polygon layer in QGIS, which will represent the avoid areas. Refer to the provided resources for detailed instructions on creating and managing temporary polygon layers. Once you have created the layer, you will adjust the corresponding parameter within the ORS Tools interface to account for the avoid areas during route calculation.

In the `Directions` Tool find the option of `Polygons to avoid` under `Advanced Parameters`. In the _ORS Tools_ window you find it under _Advanced Configuration_ --> _Avoid Polygon(s)_

```

Do you spot any difference in the isochrone shapes? Try playing around and changing the shape of your avoid area. 

## PART 2 - Multiple routes with ORS Tools


### STEP 3: Use a layer with multiple locations to create isochrones

The third task involves creating multiple directions from the disaster relief staging area to the affected communities in the Ahr Valley. With the Tool `Directions from points 2 layers` we can input one layer as origin/source and another layer as destinations. Make sure to enable `All-by-All` int the `Layer Mode` option to request a direction for every feature in layer1 x layer 2. The resulting directions will come in one single layer with multiple features.

```


### STEP 4: Repeat with avoid damaged infrastructure

Okay, repeat the same procedure but set the option `Polygons to avoid` in the Advanced Parameters section. Use `affected_roads_buff2m_WGS84.gpkg` as input.


You will experience some errors during processing like this:

```
Route from 1 to 24 caused a ApiError:
404 ({"error":{"code":2009,"message":"Route could not be found - Unable to find a route between points 1 (6.9443150 50.3316480) and 2 (6.9730780 50.4900070)."},"info":{"engine":{"version":"6.8.1","build_date":"2023-02-27T01:00:29Z"},"timestamp":1687768940091}})
```
This is due to some communities are not reachable taken into account the damaged infrastructure. Can you list all the communities not reachable by road? The error message provides you with the index of the location, but you can of course also just verify it directly in your QGIS map view.

```

## PART 3 - Single Isochrones with ORS Tools

Now we will kinda repeat the workflow above but for isochrones within QGIS. We start with single isochrone requests and later do multiple.

### STEP 5: Request single isochrones directly from the QGIS map canvas


Find the QGIS Tool `Isochrones from point` in your processing toolbox under _ORS Tools_ --> _Isochrones_. For the option `Input Point from map canvas` click the three dots on the right, then choose a location on the QGIS map canvas. This will be the location the isochrone will be calculated from. Choose range and intervals, then hit run.

---
width: 400px
name: qgis single isochrone

```


### STEP 6: Isochrones and  avoid area

Repeat the same procedure but like in task 4 add the damaged road infrastructure as avoid polygons.

```{figure} /fig/qgis_singleisochrone_avoid.png
---
width: 400px
name: qgis single isochrone
align: center
---

```


How would you describe the difference of both isochrones?

## PART 4 - Multiple Isochrones with ORS Tools

 In this second part we create isochrones from locations of physicians in the Ahr Valley, considering both regular isochrones and isochrones that account for blocked roads and damaged bridges due to infrastructure damage.

### STEP 7 Use multiple locations to request isochrones with and without avoid areas

Choose the `Isochrones from layer` Tool, it is located in your processing toolbox under _ORS Tools_ --> _Isochrones_. Instead of a single location from the map canvas, we can use a point layer open in QGIS as input. Choose the dataset `physicians.gpkg`. We will create isochrones for all physicians located in or close to the Ahr valley. For the range choose a maximum range of 30 and intervals of 5: `5,10,15,20,25,30`. Hit run.

```{figure} /fig/qgis_multipleisochrone_regular.png
---
width: 400px
name: qgis multiple isochrones
align: center
---
Multiple isochrones for Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler without avoid areas
```

Repeat the same procedure but like before with the option polygons to avoid set to the damaged infrastructure dataset.

```{figure} /fig/qgis_multipleisochrone_avoid.png
---
width: 400px
name: qgis multiple isochrones avoid
align: center
---
Multiple isochrones for Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler with avoid areas
```

As you examine the two isochrone datasets, take a closer look for any discernible patterns. When comparing these isochrones to the damaged infrastructure, pay attention to which segments of the infrastructure appear to have the greatest impact. By identifying and analyzing these areas on the map, you can gain valuable insights into the critical infrastructure segments that are likely to significantly affect healthcare accessibility. These observations will enable you to make informed decisions and prioritize the restoration of infrastructure in the Ahr Valley accordingly.

### STEP 8: Postprocess isochrones and join population counts

This final task will guide you through the postprocessing of the isochrones in QGIS using core functionalities.

The objective is to gain insights into the number of people residing in the affected municipalities who can reach a physician within a 15-minute motorized travel time, considering both the damaged infrastructure and the unaffected travel conditions.

To avoid confusion, make sure to differentiate between the two isochrone datasets by assigning them distinct names, such as `isochrones_regular` and `isochrones_avoid`.

Begin by performing an intersection between the isochrone layer and the municipalities. Utilize the `Intersection` tool in the vector processing toolbox. This step will provide information on which isochrones intersect with each municipality.

Next, dissolve the output to create continuous polygons representing travel time and municipalities. Use the `Dissolve` tool in the vector processing toolbox, specifying `name` and `AA_Mins` as the attributes for the dissolve operation. The result will generate geometries that indicate the extent of travel time for each municipality. For instance, you can determine the area within the Municipality of _Altenahr_ where residents can access a physician within 15 minutes or less.

To enrich the polygons with population counts, load the dataset on population distribution, `wpop_ahrvalley.tif`. Select the `Zonal statistic` tool from the processing toolbox. Set the dissolved layer as the input and `wpop_ahrvalley` as the raster layer. Adjust the statistics calculation to only include the sum of cell values within the zones defined by the dissolved isochrone polygons.

The result will be a comprehensive table displaying population counts for each combination of isochrone travel time and municipality. For visualization purposes, you can extract polygons based on a specific travel time value (e.g., `15`) and join them back to the `affected_municipalities` layer using the `id` field. This allows you to visualize the polygons with the added attribute of population counts.

Here is an example illustrating the population residing within a 15-minute or less travel time range in each municipality.

The grey municipalities inhabitants live outside the range of 15 minutes. May you try it with a higher threshold like 30 minutes an see for changes on municipality level.
