# Spatial Network Analysis Theory


## Understanding Networks: Analysis and Insights
Networks serve as simplified representations of real-world systems. A network comprises nodes and edges, representing entities and their relationships respectively. Rather than being defined by coordinates, positions within a network are determined by connectivity. In GIS (Geographic Information Systems), networks play integral roles in transportation modeling and supply chain networks such as water and energy distribution. Additionally, they are utilized for analyzing the service areas of healthcare facilities. For instance, analyses can assess areas vulnerable to flooding to ascertain the potential impact on healthcare services during a disaster.
