## Instructions for the trainers

:::{dropdown} __Trainers Corner__ 

### Prepare the training

- Take the time to familiarise yourself with the exercise and the provided material.
- Prepare a white-board. It can be either a physical whiteboard, a flip-chart, or a digital whiteboard (e.g. Miro board) where the participants can add their findings and questions. 
- Before starting the exercise, make sure everybody has installed QGIS and has downloaded __and unzipped__ the data folder.
- Check out [How to do trainings?](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Trainers_corner/en_how_to_training.html#how-to-do-trainings) for some general tips on training conduction

### Conduct the training

__Introduction:__

- Introduce the idea and aim of the exercise.
- Provide the download link and make sure everybody has unzipped the folder before beginning the tasks.

__Follow-along:__

- Show and explain each step yourself at least twice and slow enough so everybody can see what you are doing, and follow along in their own QGIS-project. 
- Make sure that everybody is following along and doing the steps themselves by periodically asking if anybody needs help or if everybody is still following.  
- Be open and patient to every question or problem that might come up. Your participants are essentially multitasking by paying attention to your instructions and orienting themselves in their own QGIS-project.

__Wrap up:__

- Leave time for any issues or questions concerning the tasks at the end of the exercise.
- Leave some time for open questions.

**Aina** is the GIS expert at the **Croix-Rouge Malagasy (CRM)**. With the cyclone season approaching, she knows that time is of the essence once a storm is forecasted. Every hour counts when it comes to protecting communities at risk.

This year, Aina wants to be one step ahead. Instead of manually analyzing cyclone data under pressure, she decides to **prepare an automated QGIS model** that will help her respond quickly and efficiently.

**Her goal:**  
> Build a workflow that automatically estimates exposed populations and infrastructure at risk.

## Tasks: Estimating Exposed Population ‚Äì Aina‚Äôs Manual Approach

Before developing the automated model, Aina used to estimate the exposed population manually whenever a cyclone approached Madagascar. In this task, you will follow the steps she used in the past by working with the historical track of **Cyclone Harald**, WorldPop raster data, and administrative boundaries.

You will manually buffer the cyclone track, clip the population raster, and calculate exposed population using zonal statistics.




1. **Open QGIS** and create a [new project](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_projects_folder_structure_wiki.md#step-by-step-setting-up-a-new-qgis-project-from-scratch) by clicking on `Project` -> `New`

2. **Save the project** in the ‚Äúproject‚Äù folder. To do that click on `Project` -> `Save as` and navigate to the folder. Name the project ‚ÄúCyclon_Harald_Exposure‚Äù.

3. **Load the GeoJOSN** file "Harald_2025_Track.geojson" in your project by drag and drop ([Wiki Video](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.html#open-vector-data-via-drag-and-drop)) .


4. **Reproject the cyclone track** to use meters instead of degrees (important for accurate buffering):
   - In the **Processing Toolbox**, search for `Reproject Layer`.
   - Input: `Harald_2025_Track`
   - Target CRS: `EPSG:29738` or another meter-based CRS appropriate for Madagascar.
   - Save the result in the `temp` folder as: **`Harald_Track_Reprojected`**
```{Attention}
Buffer distances must be calculated in meters. Many datasets (like GeoJSON cyclone tracks) use geographic coordinate systems like EPSG:4326, which measure in degrees ‚Äî not meters. To correctly calculate a 200 km buffer, we must first reproject the track into a projected CRS that uses meters.
```
5. **Buffer the cyclone track**:
   - In the **Processing Toolbox**, search for `Buffer`.
   - Input: `Harald_Track_Reprojected`
   - Buffer distance: `200000` (meters)
   - Segments: Leave default (5)
   - Dissolve: `Yes`
   - Save output in the `temp` folder as: **`Harald_Buffer_200km`**
6. **Reproject the buffer back to EPSG:4326 (to match the raster's CRS):**
   - In the Processing Toolbox, search for Reproject Layer.
   - Input: Harald_Buffer_200km_29738
   - Target CRS: EPSG:4326 ‚Äì WGS 84
   - Save the output in the temp folder as: Harald_Buffer_200km_4326
7. **Load the administrative boundaries**:
   - File: `MDG_adm2.gpkg`
   - Add using drag and drop or `Add Vector Layer`.
8. **Load the population raster**:
   - File: `MDG_WorldPop_2020_constrained.tif`
   - Add using `Layer` ‚Üí `Add Raster Layer`.
9. **Clip the population raster** using the buffered impact zone:
   - In the **Processing Toolbox**, search for `Clip Raster by Mask Layer`.
   - Input raster: `MDG_WorldPop_2020_constrained.tif`
   - Mask layer: `Harald_Buffer_200km`
   - Save output in the `temp` folder as: **`Harald_Pop_Clip.tif`**
10. **Calculate total exposed population**:
   - In the **Processing Toolbox**, search for `Zonal Statistics`.
   - Input vector layer: `MDG_adm2.gpkg`
   - Raster layer: `Harald_Pop_Clip.tif`
   - Statistic to calculate: `Sum`
   - Field prefix: e.g., `pop_`
   - Save the updated vector layer in the `result` folder as: **`Harald_Exposed_Population.gpkg`**
   - The result will be a new column in the attribute table of the `MDG_adm2.gpkg` layer, showing the total population within the cyclone buffer per district.
11. **Visualise the affected population by classifying the results**:
Now that Aina has estimated the exposed population in each district, she wants to clearly show the differences across regions on the map.
To do this, we'll apply a **graduated classification** to the `Harald_Exposed_Population.gpkg` layer using the new population field created by the Zonal Statistics tool.
- In the **Layers panel**, right-click on the layer `Harald_Exposed_Population` and choose `Properties`.
- Go to the **Symbology** tab on the left.
- At the top of the window, change the style from `Single Symbol` to `Graduated`.
- In the **Value** drop-down menu, select the field that contains the population sum. It typically starts with the prefix you defined earlier, e.g. `pop_sum`.
- Set the **color ramp** to one that suits your map (e.g. `Reds`).
- Choose a **classification mode** (e.g. `Quantile`, `Natural Breaks`, or `Equal Interval`) and select the number of classes (e.g. 5).
- Click `Classify` to generate the classification.
- Click `Apply` and then `OK` to display the classified map.

```{tip}
You can adjust class boundaries or labels by double-clicking on each class entry.
```


Your results should look something like this:

## üõ†Ô∏è Task 2: Automatisation of Estimating Exposed Population ‚Äì Aina's Model

After manually estimating exposed populations in past cyclone seasons, Aina has decided to prepare an **automated model** using the **QGIS Graphical Modeller**. This will help her move faster and avoid repeating the same steps manually each time a cyclone is forecasted.

In this task, you will help Aina build a simple version of that model using the tools from Task 1. The model should:

- Reproject the cyclone track to EPSG:29738  
- Buffer the cyclone track  
- Reproject the buffer back to EPSG:4326  
- Clip the population raster  
- Run Zonal Statistics to get exposed population per district

1. **Set up the model structure**:
   - Open the **Graphical Modeler** from the top menu:  
     `Processing` ‚Üí `Graphical Modeler‚Ä¶`

2. **Naming the model**:   
   - A new model window will open. On the **left side**, click on **`Model Properties`** to define basic information about the model:
     - **Model Name**: `Estimate_Exposed_Population`
     - **Group**: `Cyclone Trigger Tools`
     - Leave the description empty or write: _‚ÄúAutomated model to estimate exposed population based on cyclone buffer.‚Äù_

3. **Save the model**
   - To save the model:
     - Click the **Save** icon (üíæ) or go to `Model` ‚Üí `Save`.
     - Navigate to the **`project` folder** of your training structure.
     - Save the model as:  
       **`Estimate_Exposed_Population`**

4. **Add model inputs**:  
   - On the **left panel**, expand the **Inputs** section.
   - Add the following input layers with type constraints:
     - `+ Vector Layer`  
       - **Label**: `Cyclone Track`

       - In the **Advanced panel**, set **geometry type** to `Polygon`
   - These will appear at the top of your model canvas and serve as the input data when the model is run.

     ```{tip}
     All inputs should be set as **mandatory**, so the model always receives the necessary data to run correctly.
     ```

   - Click **OK** to add the step to the model.

10. **Validate your model (recommended)**
   - Before saving or running, click the ‚úîÔ∏è **Validate Model** button in the top toolbar.
   - Fix any warnings or errors shown in the log panel.
   - This helps ensure your model is complete and won't break during execution.

11. **Save your completed model**  
   - Once your model is finished and the final output is set, save your work.
   - Click the **Save** icon (üíæ) or go to `Model` ‚Üí `Save`.
   - Navigate to the **`project` folder** of your training structure.
   - Save the model as:  
     **`Estimate_Exposed_Population.model3`**

You can now run this model any time a new cyclone track becomes available.
