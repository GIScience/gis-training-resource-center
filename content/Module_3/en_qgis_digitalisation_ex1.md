# Digitization Exercise 1

# Aim of the exercise:

In this exercise, you will learn how to digitise points, lines, and polygons of features in settlements by creating new datasets. 

```{Attention}
Try to always use the standard folder structure. You can find a template [__here__](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_projects_folder_structure_wiki.html#standard-folder-structure).
```

We received information about droughts in several places in the state of Gedo in Somalia. This information is given as coordinates and we want to digitize this information and verify if it is true.

- Search for 5 villages in the state of Gedo.
- Write down their coordinates.
- Use OSM Placesearch to find the villages.
- Maybe also include fake information about non affected regions.
- Add two reports from which the information needs to be derived to verify which villages or infrastructure is actually affected.

- Digitise the correct information and create a new layer that contains all of this information.
- Make sure that the attribute table contains enough information (name of the villages, inhabitants, or whatever information you can find)
