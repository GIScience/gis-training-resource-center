# Geodata Selection and Queries

Geodata selection and queries in QGIS allow targeted parts of geospatial datasets to be selected. This can be utilized for filtering and analyzing geospatial information, which are essential tasks when working with spatial data.
\
\
Three general types of selection/queries in QGIS that will cover the majority of your needs include:\
**1. Manual Selection:** Selection by manually choosing features with one of various selection tools offered by QGIS. 

**2. Attribute based Selection:** Selection based on attribute values stored in the attribute table.

**3. Layer based spatial Selection:** Selecting features in one layer based on specified geometric relationships with features in another layer.


::::{admonition} Now it's your turn!

Querying data is essential to understanding and manipulating your datasets. You can follow the steps outlined below by downloading [this dataset](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038272/World-Bank-Official-Boundaries).

## Manual Selection

Manual selection is done mostly using one of the click-based selection tools available under   in your project toolbar (alternative: `Edit` > `Select`). These include `Select Feature(s)`, `Select Feature by Polygon`, `Select Feature by Freehand` and `Select Feature by Radius`.
\
\
Example: `Select Feature(s)`

1.	Click `Select Feature(s)` in the drop down menu of ![](/fig/mActionSelectRectangle.png).
2.	Select features by clicking on the or drawing a rectangle overlapping them.
3.	Use the tool outside of selectable features to end your selection.

```{Tip}
Holding down “Shift” during click-based selection allows you to select multiple features.
```

:::{dropdown} Example: Manually select country polygons by click
:open:

:::

The other options of ![](/fig/mActionSelectRectangle.png) function in a similar way, selecting all features overlapping with the respective geometry generated by the tools.

1. Click `Select Feature(s) by Polygon` in the drop down menu of ![](/fig/mActionSelectRectangle.png).
2. Select features by left clicking around the features you want to select.
3. Right-click when you are done drawing the polygon.

<video width="100%" controls src="https://github.com/GIScience/gis-training-resource-center/raw/main/fig/qgis_select_features_by_polygon.mp4"></video>

:::

```{Note}
Selected features are highlighted in bright yellow in the geospatial view and blue in the attribute table.
```

## Attribute Based Selection

A query based on specific Attributes can be done utilizing the `Select Features by Expression` tool available under ![](/fig/mActionSelectbyExpression.png) in the project toolbar and the attribute table (alternative: `Edit` > `Select` > `Select` Features by Expression).

1.	In the tool interface, expand `Fields and Values` in the right hand panel.
2.	Choose the field you want to base your selection on by double clicking it (it should now appear in the expression panel on the left-hand side).
3.	Use an expression with specific operators to specify your selection in the left hand panel (e.g ""continent"  LIKE  'Asia'" to select all features with the value “Asia” in the field "continent" ).


```{Tip}
Click on `Show Values` in the top right corner when a field is selected to get an overview over the different values of the respective field by clicking `All Unique`/`10 Samples`. Double click values to use them in the expression panel on the left.
```

## Layer Based Spatial Selection
Spatial selection of features enables selecting parts of a layer based on their relationship with features in another geospatial layer (e.g. the selection of all point features in layer A that are located within a polygon feature in Layer B). It can be achieved by using the tool “Select by Location” available under ![](/fig/mActionSelectbyLocation.png) in the project toolbar or (alternative: `Vector` > `Research Tools` > `Select by Location`).

1.	In the tool interface, choose the vector layer you want to select features from using “Select features from” and the layer you want to base the selection on using “By comparing to the features from”.
2.	Choose the geometric operator that will be used to select features (see bottom paragraph).
3.	In the bottom prompt, choose how you want to proceed with the newly selected features. The options include:
    1.	Creating a new selection.
    2.	Adding to the current selection.
    3.	Selecting within the current selection.
    4.	Removing from the current selection.

Selected features are again highlighted in bright yellow in your geospatial interface.

### Geometric Operators
 The geometric operators define the conditions of the relationship between your source and target layer that the selection will be based on. There are eight total options:


 | Operation   | Description                                                                                       | Example                                                                         |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intersect    | Features from the target layer are selected if they intersect with any features in the source layer. | Selecting all roads that cross a polygon representing a national park.          |
| Contain      | Features from the target layer are selected if they completely contain features in the source layer. | Selecting a country polygon that completely contains smaller polygons of cities. |
| Disjoint     | Features are disjoint if they do not share any common point or area.                                 | Selecting administrative districts that have no common boundary or area.       |
| Equal        | Features are equal if their geometries are identical.                                               | Selecting two line segments with the exact same set of coordinates.             |
| Touch        | Features from the target layer are selected if they touch features in the source layer.              | Selecting parks that touch a specific road.                                    |
| Overlap      | Features from the target layer are selected if they share any common space with features in the source layer. | Selecting land parcels that overlap with a proposed construction zone.        |
| Are within   | Features from the target layer are selected if they are completely within features in the source layer. | Selecting building polygons that are entirely within a polygon of a city boundary. |
| Cross        | Features from the target layer are selected if they cross features in the source layer.               | Selecting rivers that cross a road.                                           |

## Self-Assessment Questions

::::{admonition} Test your knowledge
:class: note

1. __What are the three general types of selection or queries in QGIS? Give a brief description of each.__

:::{dropdown} Answer
- __Manual selection__: 
    You select features with your mouse using the `Select Features`-tool in the map canvas or by clicking on the row column in the attribute table (the numbers on the left of the attribute table). In the map canvas, selected features will be highlighted in bright yellow, in the attribute table they are highlighted in blue. 
- __Attribute-based queries__ (Select by Attribute or Select by Expression): 
    You build a query selecting attributes with specific values (e.g. `"population" > 10000 AND "type" = 'urban'`).
- __Spatial queries__ (Select by Location):  
    You select features based on their spatial relationship to features in another layer (e.g. those that intersect, touch or are disjoint)
:::

2. __Name at least four geometric operators in spatial queries (e.g. “Intersect”, “Within”) and explain what they do.__



:::{dropdown} Answer

| Operator      | Meaning / Behavior                                                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intersect** | Selects features from layer A that intersect (share any part) with features from layer B (they overlap in any way) |
| **Within**    | Selects features of A that lie completely inside features of B                                                     |
| **Contains**  | Selects features of A that entirely contain features of B                                                          |
| **Touches**   | Selects features of A that touch (share a boundary or point) with features of B but do not overlap internally      |
| **Crosses**   | Selects features of A that pass through features of B (they cross each other)                                      |
| **Overlaps**  | Selects features of A and B that overlap but neither is completely inside the other                                |

As examples: 
- If you want all roads that cross a park boundary, use Intersect or Crosses
- If you want all building footprints entirely inside a flood zone, use Within.
