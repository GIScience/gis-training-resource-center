# Historical Impact Assessment (HIA) for Flood in Sudan
In 2023, the Sudan Red Cresent (SRCS), German Red Cross (GRC),  the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center (RCRCCC) and the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT) worked on an Early Action Protocol (EAP) for riverine floods along the River Nile in Sudan.
One of the fundamental tasks while working on an EAP is to conduct a Historical Impact Assessment (HIA), for the particular hazard. The team of HeiGIT was responsible for this particular task and this article will tell the story of how they tackled the task.
Due to the outbreak of hostilities in Sudan in 2023, the team could only rely on public data from the internet and some reports and data provided by SRCS.
By the end of 2023, the team had collected, 3.204 rows of data from 60 sources, covering the timeframe from 2012 to 2023.

## Why is a Historical Impact Assessment (HIA) Important?
A HIA has two purposes. First, understanding in detail what kind of problems are caused by a particular hazard, allows people to make informed decisions on the selection of early actions to counter those problems.
Secondly, without a good understanding of which magnitude of flood causes significant humanitarian impact, one can not adjust trigger levels accordingly to tackle those significant events.

## Task
Conduct an HIA to gain a detailed understanding of the impact of past flood events on the highest spatial and temporal resolution possible.

## Challenges

What were the main problems and challenges we faced while conducting the HIA?

### Challange 1: Scatert information on flood impacts
The one BIG challenge in this case was that there are no good datasets on flood impacts in Sudan. Practically, all information is scattered across a huge number of reports, maps, tables, dashboards and newspaper articles. Such documents can be found for example on RelifeWeb.
### Challange 2: How to get diverse data in one easy-to-use data format
Since all information about flood impacts is contained in such a diverse range of documents and formats, it is difficult to bring the information together in one dataset.
### Challange 3: Differentiating between riverine flood impacts and flash flood impacts
Riverine and flash floods often occur at the same time in the same place, so it is almost impossible to state what was the exact cause of the impact. 
And even when there was a single flash flood event, in reports it is often referred to as a flood. Hence, there is the real risk that impacts caused by flash floods are listed as river flood impacts.
## Key concept of our methodology
Our goal was to store all available impact information in one table or dataset. If we would use a classic weight table we would end up with a super clumsy table since there are so many different types of impacts a flood can cause. To avoid that we decided to use a long table.
The advantages of a long table over a classic wider table in this context are:

| Advantages          |                                                                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flexibility         | Long tables can accommodate a variable number of attributes, making them suitable for diverse datasets. |
| Scalability        | They can handle large datasets efficiently, making them suitable for compiling extensive information. |
| Ease of Integration | Simplifies the integration of data from various sources, providing a consistent structure. |
| Compatibility      | Many analysis tools work well with long-format data, making it easier to analyze and derive insights. |

### Step 1: Area of Interest
The Area of Interest (AOI) for the HeiGIT team was formally limited to Khartoum, Northern, White Nile and Sennar. However, the analysis and data collection were conducted for all states of Sudan.

### Step 2. Finding Flood Disaster Timeframes

We want to tie single pieces of information like impacts, to knowen flood events in Sudan. Thus we first need a comprehensive list of such events. In the case of Sudan, there are two sources, EM-DAT and RelifeWeb. EM-DAT is a disaster database that lists events above a certain severity. 
RelifeWeb is actually an information platform for humanitarian response. But it has a list of active and past disasters as well. 
Both databases list the same events for the most part. By comparing the two datasets and only selecting unique events, we receive a list of all significant flood events in Sudan and the timeframes of all events.

* EM-Dat lists 21 flood events in Sudan from 2000 to 2024
* Relief Web lists 29 events between 1988 and 2024

In total, there were 35 flood events reported between 1988 and 2021
In some cases, the start and end dates cannot precisely be identified. This is not a problem, we only want to have a rough overview about when there have been floods. 

```{dropdown} Flood Events List

| Start Year | Start Date | End Date   |
|------------|------------|------------|
| 1988       | 1988-08-06 | 1988-09-15 |

| 2010       | 2010-07-10 | 2010-07-15 |
| 2010       | 2010-07-01 | 2010-10-07 |
| 2012       | 2012-08-01 | 2012-08-12 |
| 2013       | 2013-08-01 | 2013-08-21 |
| 2014       | 2014-07-25 | 2014-09   |
| 2015       | 2015-08-08 | 2015-08-09 |

| 2021       | 2021-07-20 | 2021-09-24 |
```

### Step 3: Selecting datasets 

Now we search for datasets and other information for each of the flood events identified in step 2. Naturally, it will be much easier to find information on more recent events. This process can take a lot of time and sometimes needs multiple iterations.

There are three principal sources of datasets. The Sudan Red Cresent Society (SRCS), RelifeWeb and Floodlist.

Of course, much information from the different sources is redundant. A significant part of the work is to sift through the datasets and identify unique information. 


#### Datasets

We use the term data set to refer to all types of publications from which we can obtain data.
In the table below we list typical datasets used in the Sudan HIA. Remember, we can pull all kinds of information out of a dataset. It does not have to be quantitative or in table format or anything like that. It can also be info directly from texts or graphics.

##### Data selection parameters

In general, we can use any kind of dataset e.g. reports, maps, bulletins, tables…. However, we do not need to check all datasets available for one event. The selection of datasets is based on two principal parameters. 


##### Currentness

The assumption is that later after the event, the picture of what happens becomes clearer, thus the data report is more reliable.
This means., if you have multiple similar datasets containing similar data, chose the newer one.

In this example, the later map from the [13th of November](https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-situation-report-13-nov-2020-enar) shows more affected people for instance in Central Darfur the the map publihsed on the [9th of November](https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-situation-report-9-nov-2020-enar).

##### Uniqueness
It is important to not only use data from one source becaus of confience. 
The assumption is that different organisations have different capacities and work in different areas, thus they may have better information in some locations of sectors than other organisations.

#### Dataset ID
When selecting datasets it is important to save the datasets on your computer. To be able to later retrace which piece of information was taken from which datasets, we have to give the datasets unique identification codes.
In the Sudan project, we used the simple structure year of the flood the document is referring to (for example 2019), the publishing organisation (for example IFRC) and the publishing date (for example 20191003).

```

#### Step 3: Outcome 
At the end of the selection process, you should have multiple relevant datasets with IDs for every event, covering all relevant areas and sectors.

### Step 4: Preparing Excel table Structure
Before we can start compiling data, we need to prepare the table structure we will use. The table needs to accommodate four components. __Date__, __data source__, __location__,and __impact information__.

#### Date
The date information must accommodate the flood event information from the list of flood events prepared in Step 2. And potential dates of specific impact information. 
The date portion of the whole Excel table would look like this:



| Start Year | Start Date | End Date   | Date       |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 2018       | 2018-07-01 | 2018-08-29 | 2018-07-12 |
| 2019       | 2019-06-01 | 2019-06-31 |  |
|2020      | 2020-07-20 | 2020-08-11 | |

#### Data source
This section is simply one column with the ID of the dataset from which the particular information was taken.

|source_ID|
|---------|
|2018_OCHA_20180819.pdf  |
|2019_floodlist_20190613.pdf|
|2020_PDNRA_20210531.pdf|

#### Location
Practical all impact information refers to state, locality, town or refugee/IDP camp level. This means we need a column for each of these levels and one column to indicate the level the information is referring to. In this way, we can later filter for all information on for example locality level.

|admin_level | admin_1 | admin_2 | admin_3 | admin_camp|
|------------|---------|---------|---------|------------|
|      State      |    West Kordofan      |       |         |           |
|       Locality    |     South Darfur    |Beliel         |         |           |
|          Camp  |    South Darfur     |    Beliel     |         |       Kalma Camp    |

In the Sudan HIA, most of the information has been on the state level, whereas the team found very little information on the camp level.

| Admin_level       | Number of informations |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| State             | 1,979                  |
| Locality          | 596                    |
| Town/ Village     | 565                    |
| IDP & Refugee Camp| 63                     |

Tipp: We highly recommend using the English names of states and localities which are compatible with P-codes. Those can be found [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-sdn?).

#### Impact information
The actual impact information consists of two parts. One part is always the impact type. This explain what happened. For example, people were affected by the flood, the cholera broke out or schools got damaged. 

The other part is either the impact quantity or the impact quality. It can not be both! 
The impact quantity describes simply how many of something. How many people have been affected? How many schools got damaged?

The impact quality is used if something cannot be described with numbers but with "Yes" or "No". For example, there was a disease outbreak of cholear. Cholera is not a number. Yes there was cholera outbreak. Or a locality was affected -> Yes the locality was affected.

Hence we need three columns to describe impacts: impact_typ, impact_quality and impact_quantity.

| impact_typ | impact_quality | impact_quantity |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| houses_damaged_totaly           |   2500             |                 |
|      deaths      |              6    |               |
|      disease_cholera      |               |         yes         |

It makes sense to list some of the basic impact types we are interested in or which are very commonly reported. Such as affected people or deaths. The list of impact types can be extended on the fly. It is however important to stay consistent.
The HeiGIT team used 75 different impact types. You can find the whole list below.

#### Step 4: Outcome
Now we have your final table structure. We can put ALL information from the selected datasets we deem relevant into this table structure thus creating a consistent historical impact dataset.


| Start Year | Start Date | End Date   | Date       | source_ID              | admin_level | admin_1        | admin_2 | admin_3 | admin_camp   | impact_typ           | impact_quality | impact_quantity |

#### Tipps for data compiling

Compiling the data in EXCEL is a time-intensive and repeatable task. Here are some tips to speed up the process:

##### Excel copy function:
Try to use the copy function of Excel as much as possible. When taking info from a map, the information in the columns, year, start_date, end_date, date, Source_ID, and admin_level usually stay the same. So you can just copy and paste this information. In most cases, you should only write the name of location, Impact_type, Impact_quality and Impact_quantity.

###### Use ChatGPT:
If you encounter tables that do not fit into your table structure use ChatGPT to turn them into a long table format. For example, look at the image in the table below. 

 
```{figure} /fig/Sudan_DREF_final_report_flood_2013_impact_table.png

width: 600px

align: center
---
```

You can copy the content which produces this text:

Go to ChatGPT and use a prompt like
„Can you turn this information taken from a Table into a long table format?“ + the table as text 

Probably you will have to ask ChatGPT to give you the whole table. Something like: "Super good! Can you give me a table on the other states as well?
"

###### Use Gemini AI:
Google Gemini Can also handle images. For example, it can turn this graph into a table which is much easier to handle than copying everything by hand.



```{figure} /fig/Sudan_flood_impact_table_2016.png

The resulting table can easily be adjusted in Excel.

## HIA Data Cleaning

When creating such a dataset there will be errors like misspellings of names or wrong numbers. To address that you will need to clean the dataset before actually using it. To clean the dataset you can use Excel or specialized tools like [OpenRefein](https://openrefine.org/).

```{Tipp} OpenRefein
OpenRefein is a free and open-source specialized data cleaning software.
You download once the folder with the installation files. To start OpenRefein you need to double-click openrefine.exe. The software will run in your browser! -> [Installation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTlTboXoGj4)

OpenRefein Beginner Tutorials -> __[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfS1qTKFQoI)__
```


Independently on which tool you will use, here are some important points you have to check when cleaning the data:

1. **Year and Columns:**
   - Check if all values are within the expected range of years.
   - Ensure that there are no missing or invalid year values becaus we need a year information for all data
   - *OpenRefine Step:* Use the "Text facet" or "Numeric facet" to explore the distribution of values in the Year column. Use the "Text filter" or "Numeric filter" to filter out any rows with invalid or missing year values.

2. **Date Columns (Start_Date, End_Date, Date):**
   - Check if all dates are in the correct date format.
   - Ensure that there are no  inconsistent date values.
   - *OpenRefine Step:* Use the "Edit cells" > "Common transforms" > "To date" option to convert date columns to a standard date format. Use the "Text facet" to identify and correct any inconsistencies in formatting or missing dates.

3. **source_ID Column:**
   - Check that there is only one way of spelling for every individual source_ID! 
   - Check if all source IDs follow a consistent naming convention.
   - Ensure that there are no missing source IDs.
   - *OpenRefine Step:* Use the "Text facet" to explore the distribution of values in each admin level column. Click on `Cluster` and set `Method` to `Key collision`or `Nearest neighbor`. Adjust wrong names by checking `Merge` and adjust the `New cell value` and click on `Merge selected & re-cluster`

4. **Admin Columns (admin_level, admin_1, admin_2, admin_3, admin_camp):**
   - Check if all administrative units are correctly categorized.
   - Ensure that there are no misspelled or inconsistent administrative unit names.
   - *OpenRefine Step:* Use the "Text facet" to explore the distribution of values in each admin level column. Click on [`Cluster`](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/cellediting#cluster-and-edit) and set `Method` to `Key collision` or `Nearest neighbor`. Consolidate the of states and loclities that they are consisten with the list in the [location chapter](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/GIS_AA/en_qgis_historical_impact_assessment_sudan.html#location).Adjust wrong names by checking `Merge` and adjust the `New cell value` and click on `Merge selected & re-cluster` 

5. **Impact Type Column:**
   - Check if all impact types are correctly categorized and named.
   - Ensure that there are no duplicate or missing impact types.
   - *OpenRefine Step:* Use the "Text facet" to explore the distribution of values in each admin level column. Click on [`Cluster`](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/cellediting#cluster-and-edit) and set `Method` to `Key collision` or `Nearest neighbor`. Adjust wrong names by checking `Merge` and adjust the `New cell value` and click on `Merge selected & re-cluster`

6. **Impact Quantity Columns:**
   - Check if all numerical values are within expected ranges.
   - Ensure that there are no missing or invalid numerical values.
   - *OpenRefine Step:* Use the "Numeric facet" to explore the distribution of values in each numerical column. Use the "Edit cells" or "Transform" option to handle missing or invalid values, and standardize formatting.

7. **Impact Quality Columns:**
   - Check that the same impacts are spelt consistently. For example illness names.
   - *OpenRefine Step:* Use the "Text facet" to explore the distribution of values in each admin level column. Click on [`Cluster`](https://openrefine.org/docs/manual/cellediting#cluster-and-edit) and set `Method` to `Key collision` or `Nearest neighbor`. Adjust wrong names by checking `Merge` and adjust the `New cell value` and click on `Merge selected & re-cluster`
8. **Delete redundant data**
    - It might be the case that you have for one flood event, multiple information on for example affected populations for the same location. This could later be a problem when you want to analyse the data.
    Probably, the reddened information is from two different sources. So you can delete the information of the older source and only keep the one from the up-to-date source as possible.


## Adding P-Codes to the table

## Working with the impact table in Excel

Now we have our impact dataset cleaned and ready to use. Since the dataset is a long table we cannot use it as a normal table in Excel. To get the data in a format so we can use it in QGIS or create a graph out of it, we need to pivot it. Depending on your work with impact quantity or quality, there are small differences. Here is how you do it:

### Impact Quantity for one year on state level:
1. Open the Excel dataset.
2. Turn the data in a table by clicking on `Insert` -> `Table`-> check `My table has headers`
3. Also under the `Insert`-Tab click on `Pivot Table`. Make sure your table range is correct. Check `New Worksheet`. Click `OK`.
4. Setup the pivot table by placing the columns as follows:
  - Filter: Start_year
  - Columns: Impact_Type
  - Rows: admin_1 or admin_1_PCODE (If you want to use this table in QGIS, you should use admin_1_PCODE Instead of admin_1)
  - Values: Impact_quantity
5. To see the sum of the different impacts click on Impact_quantity under Values -> `Value Field Settings` -> select `Sum`.
6. Directly above the pivot table, you should see the option to filter by year. Select the year you are interested in. For the following example the year 2020 was used.

Now you can just copy the whole table, and place it in a new worksheet. Make sure to only paste the values. Save this output as a CSV-file, this will make the import of the subset into QGIS easier. Now we can use this table to join it with an existing geodataset in QGIS. 

#### How to further analyse and visualise data in QGIS

1. Import the previously created CSV-file into QGIS. Open the `Data Source Manager` and select the `Delimited Text` section. Here you can input your CSV-file and depending on the `File Format` you need to define Costum delimiters or you can just select CSV. Always check the Sample Data output at the bottom to see if the import is working as expected. You propably will also need to check the `Record and Fields Options` and specify if your first record is a header or already data. Lastly, it is important to specify the `Geometry Definition`, were you can just select `No geometry`. An example will be shown in {numref}`HIA_csv_import`.

2. For this example we will use geodata that contains information about the states of Sudan. Make sure that your geodata has the admin_1_PCODE column that will be used for joining the table data with the geodata. We will use the tool `Join attributes by field value`. And select the corresponding columns. This is shown in {numref}`HIA_join` below.

```

The information can now be visualized on a spatial scale and maps can be created to transport important information. An example could be to visualize the total affected population for the year of 2020 on state level. But we can also visualize more specific impact types such as damaged schools or damaged sanitation. This is how such a map could look like.
