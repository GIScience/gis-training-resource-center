# Historical Impact Assessment (HIA) for Flood in Sudan
In 2023, the Sudan Red Cresent (SRCS), German Red Cross (GRC),  the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center (RCRCCC) and the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT) worked on an Early Action Protocol (EAP) for riverine floods along the River Nile in Sudan.
One of the fundamental tasks while working on an EAP is to conduct a Historical Impact Assessment (HIA), for the particular hazard. The team of HeiGIT was responsible for this particular task and this article will tell the story of how they tackled the task.
Due to the outbreak of hostilities in Sudan in 2023, the team could only rely on public data from the internet and some reports and data provided by SRCS.
By the end of 2023, the team had collected, 3.204 rows of data from 60 sources, covering the timeframe from 2012 to 2023.

## Why is a Historical Impact Assessment (HIA) Important?
A HIA has two purposes. First, understanding in detail what kind of problems are caused by a particular hazard, allows people to make informed decisions on the selection of early actions to counter those problems.
Secondly, without a good understanding of which magnitude of flood causes significant humanitarian impact, one can not adjust trigger levels accordingly to tackle those significant events.

## Task
Conduct an HIA to gain a detailed understanding of the impact of past flood events on the highest spatial and temporal resolution possible.

## Challenges

What were the main problems and challenges we faced while conducting the HIA?

### Challange 1: Scatert information on flood impacts
The one BIG challenge in this case was that there are no good datasets on flood impacts in Sudan. Practically, all information is scattered across a huge number of reports, maps, tables, dashboards and newspaper articles. Such documents can be found for example on RelifeWeb.
### Challange 2: How to get diverse data in one easy-to-use data format
Since all information about flood impacts is contained in such a diverse range of documents and formats, it is difficult to bring the information together in one dataset.
### Challange 3: Differentiating between riverain flood impacts and flash flood impacts
Ricereich and flash floods often occur at the same time in the same place, so it is almost impossible to state what was the exact cause of the impact. 
And even when there was a single flash flood event, in reports it is often referred to as a flood. Hence, there is the real risk that impacts caused by flash floods are listed as river flood impacts.
## Key concept of our methodology
Our goal was to store all available impact information in one table or dataset. If we would use a classic weight table we would end up with a super clumsy table since there are so many different types of impacts a flood can cause. To avoid that we decided to use a long table.
The core of a long table is the Key + Value concept.

### Step 1: Area of Interest
The Area of Interest (AOI) for the HeiGIT team was formally limited to Khartoum, Northern, White Nile and Sennar. However, the analysis and data collection were conducted for all states of Sudan.
