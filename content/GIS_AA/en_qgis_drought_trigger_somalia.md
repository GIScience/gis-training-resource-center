# QGIS Trigger Workflow for Somalia 

üößThis training platform and the entire content is under ‚ö†Ô∏èconstruction‚ö†Ô∏è and may not be shared or published! üöß

The QGIS workflow presented in this article was developed in the framework of the Forecast-based-Action (FbF) Project of the Somalia Red Cresent Society (SRCS), the German Red Cross (GRC) and the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT).

The workflow consists of 15 steps of which 9 are automated in the form of a QGIS Model. In this article, we explain how all 15 steps can be done manually. In practice one needs to do only 6 steps manually, the rest is done by the QGSI Model.
The chapter Workflow Automated explains the process and how it is intended in practice. The chapter Workflow Manually is to understand what happens inside of the QGIS Model.

## Background

Setting triggers is one of the cornerstones of the Forecast-based Financing system. For a National Society to have access to automatically released funding for their early actions, their Early Action Protocol needs to clearly define where and when funds will be allocated, and assistance will be provided. In FbF, this is decided according to specific threshold values, so-called triggers, based on weather and climate forecasts, which are defined for each region (see [FbF Manual](https://manual.forecast-based-financing.org/en/chapter/set-the-trigger/)).

For the development of the Somaliland-Somalia Drought Trigger mechanism various datasources were thoroughly analysed.
Finally, the main parameters chosen for the trigger based on the historical impact assessment are the twelve month Standard Precipitation Index (SPI12) and the IPC acute food insecurity classification. The exact data used are the documented and forecasted SPI12 (source: ICPAC) and the forecasted IPC classification (8 month forecast, source: FEWSNET), that is used to calculate a population weighted index of food insecurity. The trigger thresholds for both components were optimised towards the most favourable proportion of hit rate and false alarm rate. The emerging thresholds were <-1 for the SPI12 and >=0,7 for the IPC based index. The triggering is done on district level and per district just one trigger initiation per year is possible.

## Trigger Statement

When ICPAC issues a SPI-12 forecast of less than -1 for a district AND the current FEWSNET food insecurity projection reaches at least 0.7 in its 
derived population weighted index in the same district, then we will act in this district. We expect the lead-time to be 90 days.


##  Trigger Input Data

For the trigger mechanism to work properly we currently use different datasets: data that we assume to be fixed in the near term, and variable data which describe the datasets that will be checked for triggering on a monthly base. 

### Fixed Data

By fixed data we mean datasets that are needed for the trigger to work, that will most probably not change in the near term. In the long term these datasets can be adapted easily.

| Dataset| Source | Description |
| ----- | --- | --- |
|Adminstrative bounderies | [HDX](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/cod-ab-som?) |The administrative bounderies on level 0-2 for Somalia and Somaliland can be accessed via HDX. For this trigger mechanism we provide the administrative bounderies on level 2 (district level) as a shapefile. We have added the population number for each district derived from Worldpop.|
|Population Counts| [Worldpop](https://hub.worldpop.org/doi/10.5258/SOTON/WP00534) |The worldpop dataset in .geotif rasterformat provides population estimates per hectar for the year 2020 |



### Monitoring Data

The drought trigger mechanism is based on two variable monitoring datasets updated monthly: The SPI-12 forecast produced by ICPAC and the Food Insecurity projection produced by FEWSNET. The SPI-12 is used to capture hazard forecasts while the Food Insecurity Projection captures the dynamic vulnerability. 
In this way upcoming drought events (SPI) that most probably will lead to food insecurity (IPC) will be captured.

| Dataset| Source | Description |
| ----- | --- | --- |
|SPI-12 forecast| [ICPAC](https://www.icpac.net/) |meteorological drought indicator to monitor precipitation anomalies over 12-month accumulation periods|
|IPC Projections| [FEWSNET](https://fews.net/) | five-phase scale providing common standards for classifying the severity of acute or anticipated acute food insecurity. |



### What is the Standarized Precipitation Index (SPI-12)?

The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a widely used index to characterize meteorological drought.
The Standarized Precipitation Index (SPI-12) compares the total rainfall received at a particular location during the last 12 months with the long-term rainfall mean (42 years) for the same period of time at that location.




### What is IPC Food Security Projection Data?
 
The IPC is a commonly acceepted measure and classification to describe the current and anticipated severity of acute food insecurity. 
The classification is based on a convergence of available data and evidence, including indicators related to food consumption, livelihoods, malnutrition and mortality. Food Insecurity is one of the prioritized impacts of droughts in Somalia which is why it is also used for the triggering mechanism, in a population-weighted index. 

| Colour| Phase | Descriptions |
| ----- | --- | --- |
|![](/fig/IPC_Class_1.drawio.svg)|1. Minimal   |Households are able to meet essential food and non-food needs without engaging in atypical and unsustainable strategies to access food and income.   |
|![](/fig/IPC_Class_2.drawio.svg)|2. Stressed   |Households have minimally adequate food consumption but are unable to afford some essential non-food expenditures without engaging in stress-coping strategies.  |
|![](/fig/IPC_Class_3.drawio.svg)|3. Crisis   |Households either have food consumption gaps that are reflected by high or above-usual acute malnutrition __OR__ are marginally able to meet minimum food needs but only by depleting essential livelihood assets or through crisis-coping strategies.  |
|![](/fig/IPC_Class_4.drawio.svg)|4. Emergency|Households either have large food consumption gaps which are reflected in very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality; __OR__ are able to mitigate large food consumption gaps but only by employing emergency livelihood strategies and asset liquidation.|
|![](/fig/IPC_Class_5.drawio.svg)|5. Famine |Households have an extreme lack of food and/or other basic needs even after full employment of coping strategies. Starvation, death, destitution, and extremely critical acute malnutrition levels are evident. (For Famine Classification, area needs to have extreme critical levels of acute malnutrition and mortality.)  |


#### IPC Food Security Projection:

Three times a year (February, June, and October) FEWSNET estimates most likely IPC classes for the upcoming 8 month (near-term and mid-term projection), available from 2019-current. The near-term projection is called ML1 and is a projection for the upcoming 4 month, the mid-term projection is called ML2 and projects the IPC classes for the 4 subsequent months. For the triggering ML1 (near-term) as well as ML2 (mid-term) projections will be considered. 

Outlook updates are produced almost every month and are also taken into account.


#### IPC-Population Weighted Index

To better operationalise the IPC data a simple population-weigthed index was developed. Relative population numbers are weighted based on the respective IPC class they fallin, in order to give the amount of people in a certain IPC class the importance instead of the IPC class only.
Furthermore, population located in a higher IPC class is more important than population located in a lower class. The index is calculated as follows:

$ IPC\ Index =  Weights \times \frac{District\ Pop\ per\ IPC\ Phase}{Total\ District\ Pop}$

Where the weights are defined as:

| IPC Pahse| Weight |
| ----- | --- |
|IPC 1  |0  |
|IPC 2  |0  |
|IPC 3  |1  |
|IPC 4  |3  |
|IPC 5  |6  |


The IPC Index represents low-population districts equal to high-population districts. No underrepresentation of high food insecurity of small districts occurs.


# Trigger Workflow Automated 

As explained in the beginning of this [chapter](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/GIS_AA/en_qgis_drought_trigger_somalia.html#qgis-trigger-workflow-for-somalia), the 9 main steps of the developed trigger workflow are done automatically by a QGIS model. In the previous chapters you have learned the purpose and needed tools of each step and how to perform them manually. In this chapter it is explained how to run the automated model.

The [QGIS Model Designer](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_automatisation_wiki.html#the-qgis-model-designer) is a visual tool that allows users to create and edit a workflow with all tools available in QGIS that can be used repeatedly in a simple and time-efficient manner. It provides a graphical interface to build workflows by connecting geoprocessing tools and algorithms. The user can define inputs, outputs, and the flow of data between different processing steps.

### Step 1: Setting up folder structure

width: 1000px
name: 
align: center
---
```


__Tool:__ FileZilla and Interent Browser

The current plans provide that ICPAC will monthly provide the SPI-12 forcast whereas the IPC data will be pulled from the FEWSNET website. FEWS NET publishes IPC data on its website. 
The main data publications plus the updates of the IPC data amount to the publication of new data almost monthly.

### SPI-12 Data


ICPAC will provide the SPI-12 forecasts on their FTP (File Transfer Protocol). There are different ways to access the FTP-Server. We recommend to install and once set up [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64). This will make your work easily repeatable on a monthly basis.

1. Download Filezilla [here](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64).
2. Install the `.exe` file you have downloaded 
3. Open FileZilla


4. Establish a connection to the FTP Server by insterting the credentials you have been passed (Host, Username and Password) and clicking `Quickconnect`.


In FileZilla you have four windows. On the left hand side you will see the folder on your computer in the upper window. By clicking on a folder, the documents in the folder will be shown in the lower left window.
On the right hand side, you will see in the upper window the FTP data folder and by clicking on it, the data will be shown in the lower right window.

In order to pass the data from the FTP Server to your own machine you can simply drag and drop the folder or data from the righthandside windows (FTP-Server) to the lefthandside windows (your Computer). To do so, firstly navigate to your folder where you wneed the latest SPI-12 data to be located `.../FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger/Monitoring/Year_Month_template/SPI_12`. Then drag and drop the latest SPI-12 into the folder.

### IPC Data

The IPC Projection data is provided and regulary updated on the [FEWSNET Website](https://fews.net/).
On the website you will have to click on Somalia to acess the data. Alternativley, you can  navigate through `Data` -> `Acute Food Insecurity Data` and enter ‚ÄûSomalia". In the menu you will see different dataformats for different timestamps. Once you find out which timestamp is the most current one find the ZIP download. We need the data in shapefile (.shp) format, which is only included in the ZIP file and not provided as single download file. 


```{Warning}
The FEWSNET pages change often !
```

1. Go to [FEWSNET Website](https://fews.net/). Click on `Data` -> `Acute Food Insecurity`.
2. Scroll down. In `Geograhic Area` typ in ‚ÄúSomalia‚Äù and click `Apply`
3. Choose the newest dataset.

5. When you have downloaded the data, right-click on the file and click on `Extract all` -> `Extract`
6. Open the extracted folder and copy the ML1 data in the IPC_ML1 folder you have created in step 1. 
  * The filename is composed of "SO" for Somalia, year and month of the report month e.g `SO_202308_ML1.shp`
  Example path: `.../FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger/Monitoring/Year_Month_template/IPC_ML1`
7. Copy the ML2 data into IPC_ML2 folder you have created in step 1.
  * The filename is composed of "SO" for Somalia, year and month of the report month e.g `SO_202308_ML2.shp`
  Example path: `.../FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger/Monitoring/Year_Month_template/IPC_ML2`
```{Warning}
Make sure to not use the ML1_IDP data which comes in the .zip folder as well!
```

```{Warning}
Remember that you need to copy over all components that the respective [shapefile](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_geodata_types_wiki.html#vector-data) is composed of. Most probably it has 5 components: .cpg, .dbf, .prj, .shp, and .shx.

```{Attention}
Make sure you edit the Map Information on the template, e.g. current date. Also make sure to check the legend items: Remove unnecessary items and eventually change the names to meaning descriptions.
```


In order to easily visualize the output of the trigger analysis we provide you with a 
[map template](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Modul_4/en_qgis_map_design_2.html#map-templates) that can be used as a base for your visualization. You can find the template in the following directory: ".../FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger/maps_somalia_template_risk_assessment.qpt".

You can also adapt the template to your needs and preferences. You can find help [here](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Modul_4/en_qgis_map_design_2.html#print-layout).

### Step 2: Download of the forecast data

```{figure} /fig/Drought_EAP_Worklow_Step_2_2.png
---
width: 1000px
name: 
align: center
---
```

__Purpose:__ 

__Tool:__ FileZilla and Interent Browser

The current plans provide that ICPAC will monthly provide the SPI-12 forcast whereas the IPC data will be pulled from the FEWSNET website. FEWS NET publishes IPC data on its website. 
The main data publications plus the updates of the IPC data amount to the publication of new data almost monthly.

### SPI-12 Data


ICPAC will provide the SPI-12 forecasts on their FTP (File Transfer Protocol). There are different ways to access the FTP-Server. We recommend to install and once set up [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64). This will make your work easily repeatable on a monthly basis.

1. Download Filezilla [here](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?platform=win64).
2. Install the `.exe` file you have downloaded 
3. Open FileZilla


4. Establish a connection to the FTP Server by insterting the credentials you have been passed (Host, Username and Password) and clicking `Quickconnect`.


In FileZilla you have four windows. On the left hand side you will see the folder on your computer in the upper window. By clicking on a folder, the documents in the folder will be shown in the lower left window.
On the right hand side, you will see in the upper window the FTP data folder and by clicking on it, the data will be shown in the lower right window.

In order to pass the data from the FTP Server to your own machine you can simply drag and drop the folder or data from the righthandside windows (FTP-Server) to the lefthandside windows (your Computer). To do so, firstly navigate to your folder where you wneed the latest SPI-12 data to be located `.../FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger/Monitoring/Year_Month_template/SPI_12`. Then drag and drop the latest SPI-12 into the folder.

### IPC Data

The IPC Projection data is provided and regulary updated on the [FEWSNET Website](https://fews.net/).
On the website you will have to click on Somalia to acess the data. Alternativley, you can  navigate through `Data` -> `Acute Food Insecurity Data` and enter ‚ÄûSomalia". In the menu you will see different dataformats for different timestamps. Once you find out which timestamp is the most current one find the ZIP download. We need the data in shapefile (.shp) format, which is only included in the ZIP file and not provided as single download file. 


```{Warning}
The FEWSNET pages change often !
```

1. Go to [FEWSNET Website](https://fews.net/). Click on `Data` -> `Acute Food Insecurity`.
2. Scroll down. In `Geograhic Area` typ in ‚ÄúSomalia‚Äù and click `Apply`
3. Choose the newest dataset.

```
4. Download the one with the __ZIP__ Data
5. When you have downloaded the data, right-click on the file and click on `Extract all` -> `Extract`
6. Open the extracted folder and copy the ML1 data in the IPC_ML1 folder you have created in step 1. 
  * The filename is composed of "SO" for Somalia, year and month of the report month e.g `SO_202308_ML1.shp`
  Example path: `.../FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger/Monitoring/Year_Month_template/IPC_ML1`
7. Copy the ML2 data into IPC_ML2 folder you have created in step 1.
  * The filename is composed of "SO" for Somalia, year and month of the report month e.g `SO_202308_ML2.shp`
  Example path: `.../FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger/Monitoring/Year_Month_template/IPC_ML2`
```{Warning}
Make sure to not use the ML1_IDP data which comes in the .zip folder as well!
```

```{Warning}
Remember that you need to copy over all components that the respective [shapefile](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_geodata_types_wiki.html#vector-data) is composed of. Most probably it has 5 components: .cpg, .dbf, .prj, .shp, and .shx.

### Step 3: Loading data into QGIS

```{figure} /fig/Drought_EAP_Worklow_Step_3_1.png
---
width: 1000px
name: 
align: center
---
```

__Purpose:__ In this step, all the data needed will be loaded into QGIS.

__Tool:__ No specific tools are needed, only QGIS.

1. Open QGIS and create a [new project](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_projects_folder_structure_wiki.html#step-by-step-setting-up-a-new-qgis-project-from-scratch) by clicking on `Project` -> `New`
2. Once the project is created save the project in the folder you created in Step 1 (e.g. 2022_05). To do that click on `Project` -> `Save as` and navigate to the folder. Give the project the same name as the folder you created (e.g. 2022_05). Then click `Save`
3. Load all input data in QGIS by [drag and drop](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.html#open-raster-data-via-drag-and-drop). Click on `Project` -> `Save` 
  * From the folder you created in step 1
    * ML1
    * ML2
    * SPI-12
  * From the `Fixes_data` folder:
    * district_pop_som
    * Regions
    * risk_assessment.gpkg
    * WorldPop_som.tif

__Result:__ QGIS project with all necessary data ready to be analysed. 

This video shows how to setup the QGIS project for April 2022 and how to import all data into the project.

```

__Purpose:__ The purpose of this step is to gain a quick overview of possible trigger activation without having to revise the actual data. Instead we will have a binary column with trigger = yes or trigger=no values.

__Tool:__ [`Field Calculator`](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_table_functions_wiki.html#calculate-field)



1. Right-click on "IPC_index_SPI_12_district" layer -> `Attribute Table`-> click on  [`Field Calculator`](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_table_functions_wiki.html#calculate-field) ![](/fig/mActionCalculateField.png) to open the field calculator
2. Check `Create new field`
3. `Output field name`: Name the new column ‚ÄúTrigger_activation‚Äù
4. `Result field type`: Text (string)
5. Add the code below into the `Expression` field
``````{list-table}
:header-rows: 1
:widths: 15

* - Code
* - ```md
    CASE

    WHEN "Index_per_IPCPolygon_ML1_mean" >0.7 AND "Index_per_IPCPolygon_ML2_mean" > 0.7
    AND
    "SPI12_mean" < -1
    THEN 'yes'
    ELSE 'no'

    END
    ```
``````
6. Click `ok`
7. Save the new column by clicking on ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) in the attribute table and end the editing mode by clicking on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png)

__Result:__ A layer with all districts of Somalia with a column of "Yes" and "No" values indicating whether the trigger levels have been reached or not.

__Purpose:__ Viualization of the map features in a printable map layout

__Tool:__  [Print Layout](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Modul_4/en_qgis_map_design_2.html?highlight=print+layout#print-layout)


1. If not done before, delet all layers expect __Trigger_activation__, __risk_assessment_districts__ and __OpenStreetMap__
2. Open a new print layout by clicking on `Project` -> `New Print Layout` -> enter the name of your current Project e.g "2022_04".
3. Go the the __FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger__` folder and drag and drop the file `Trigger_activation_Intervention_map.qpt` in the print layout
4. Change the date to the current date by clicking on "Further map info‚Ä¶" in the items panel. Click on the `Item Properties` tab and scroll down. Here you can change the date in the `Main Properties` field.
5. Adjust the Lgend by clicking on the legend in the  `Item Properties` tab and scroll down until you see the `Legend items` field. If it is not there check if you have to open the dropdown. Make sure `Auto update` is not checked.
    * Remove all itemes in the legend be clicking on the item and then on the red minus icon below.
    * Add __Trigger_activation__ and __risk_assessment_districts__ to the legend by clicking on the green plus and click on the layer and click `ok`

<video width="100%" controls muted src="https://github.com/GIScience/gis-training-resource-center/raw/main/fig/SRCS_Trigger_print_map.mp4"></video>
```

```{Attention}
Make sure you edit the Map Information on the template, e.g. current date. Also make sure to check the legend items: Remove unnecessary items and eventually change the names to meaning descriptions.
```


In order to easily visualize the output of the trigger analysis we provide you with a 
[map template](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Modul_4/en_qgis_map_design_2.html#map-templates) that can be used as a base for your visualization. You can find the template in the following directory: ".../FbF_Drought_Monitoring_Trigger/maps_somalia_template_risk_assessment.qpt".

You can also adapt the template to your needs and preferences. You can find help [here](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Modul_4/en_qgis_map_design_2.html#print-layout).

```{Attention}
Make sure you edit the Map Information on the template, e.g. current date. Also make sure to check the legend items: Remove unnecessary items and eventually change the names to meaning descriptions.
