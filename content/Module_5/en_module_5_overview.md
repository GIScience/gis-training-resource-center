# Intermediate GIS Operations

This chapter introduces more intermediate GIS operations that you will most likely use in your work with QGIS. 

- The first chapter covers spatial operations that manipulate data according to their spatial characteristics and distribution, such as __clipping__, __buffering__, __dissolving__, __spatial joins__, or __selecting by location__.
    - For example, you can select the hospitals within a certain distance of an area, or delete all the roads that are not within a part of the city. 
- The second chapter introduces operations that manipulate the non-spatial information, such as __table functions__, __non-spatial joins__ or __non-spatial queries__.
