# Exercise Overview

This platform offers various exercises per module, each covering the competences and tools covered in the module chapter. The exercise vary in their complexity and their length. When planning a workshop, pay attention to the competences covered in the exercises you choose. Ideally, you should cover the core competences of each module. 

We have also prepared exercise tracks, which cover the competences from module 1 to module 5 in exercises, that build upon each other. These exercises are generally a bit larger and require more time.
