# Exercise Track: Larkana Flood Response

This exercise track focuses on the assessment of flood impact on the health and logistics sector. In this track, you'll step into the role of a information manager analysing flood impacts in Larkana, Pakistan. You'll learn how to find secondary data and export data from OpenStreetMap, perform basic spatial analyses identifying flood impacted healthsites, create informative maps, and digitise new data. This hands-on track is designed to build practical GIS-skills while exploring how geospatial tools support real-world __disaster response__ efforts.  
The exercise track starts in module 2 with 2 exercises and continues through module 3, 4 and 5 with one exercise each.
