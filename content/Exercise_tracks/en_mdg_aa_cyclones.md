# Exercise Track: Anticipatory Action Analysis for Cyclones in Madagascar

üößThis part of training platform is under ‚ö†Ô∏èconstruction‚ö†Ô∏è and may not be shared or published! üöß

This exercise track focuses on the preliminary assessment of a cyclone event in Madagascar. The goal is to create 
an analytical workflow as a QGIS model that estimates the exposed population, exposed infrastructure, and exposed 
agriculture land. Additionally, the accessibility of exposed regions can be assessed using pre-calculated 
isochrones. 
In this track, you will build an analytical workflow as a QGIS model and visualise the results using map templates 
and style files.
