# Exercise 0: Understanding the Interface

### Aim to the exercise

QGIS is a complex program with an immense amount of functions. At first glance, the interface may seem confusing. This exercise aims to make you familiar with the main toolbars, windows and panels of QGIS. You will learn to create a new QGIS-Project and save it in a desired location, and how to find and navigate through the different panels and toolbars.

- saving and loading a QGIS-Project
- learn where toolbars are situated
- learn where panels are situated
- move panels around
- learn how to activate and find missing panels
- opening settings


### Data

In this exercise, we will not be using any data. Instead, we will be learning how to navigate throught the different interfaces and how to save and load a QGIS project.
- You can download the zipped template folder structure from the Nexus: `Modul_1` > `Exercise_0`. 
- If you have already set up a template folder you can skip this part. 

### Tasks

1. First let us create a new project. When opening QGIS, you will be greeted by the start menu. Beneath this you will see a panel labeled `Project Template`. 
    - __Double Click on the Empty Project option__. You will be greeted with a white canvas since there is no data loaded into QGIS yet. 
2. First, let's focus on the QGIS interface: Above the Canvas, you will find the __toolbar__ with a lot of different functions. To the left and right of the canvas 
In QGIS, most of the work is done either with __toolbars__ or __panels__. 
- Toolbars let you switch between different functions of your mouse and are situated above the map canvas and panels. 

- Panels are used to modify further settings for the tools, select algorithm, work with plugins and control most the main functions of QGIS. By default, you will have two panels on the left: the __Browser__ and __Layer__ panels. In the layer panel, you will see the data we just added. On the right side, you will most likely have the __Processing Toolbox__ panel and __Layer Styling__ panels. You can detach panels from the sides by simply clicking and dragging the panel away. You can either clip it to another panel (it will appear as another tab), or turn it into its own window. 
You can also resize the panels.

```{TIP}
Depending on the screen you are working on, the QGIS-Interface might look a little different. Sometimes elements can be hidden because it is not rendered correctly by default. Try resizing the panels and look at the different options and functions they offer. 
```

___But these are far from being the only panels you will use when working in QGIS.___ Let's see how we can find and activate the other panels and toolbars

- Navigate to the `View` Options and search for the `panels` and `toolbar` options. Hear you will see a long list of panels and toolbars you can activate. Panels that are active and can be found in the QGIS interface are marked with a check mark. Give yourself a minute to look at the different toolbars and panels. Do not worry, you will not use most of them when working with QGIS. The most important panels are: 
    - The layers panel
    - The layer styling
    - The processing toolbox
    - the browser

Now, let's take a look at the toolbars: The most important toolbars are:
    - the project toolbar
    - the map navigation toolbar
    - the digitizing toolbar
    - the selection toolbar
    - the attributes toolbar

Take the time and make yourself familiar with the different ways you can arrange the QGIS Interface. Knowing where to find the different functions can save you a lot of time and frustration in the future!

3. Let us now save the project. Click on the Save-Icon in the top left or navigate through `Project` > `Save as..`
4. Choose a location for the project file. An ideal place would be in the project subfolder in the template folder. Navigate to the folder called `Modul_1_Exercise_0` and open the subfolder called `Project`. Select this location and give the QGIS-project a name (for example: `QGIS_Training_Exercise_0`). The Project will be saved as a `.qqz`-file.
5. Click Save.
6. Close the QGIS-Application and Reopen it.
7. Once QGIS started again, the project we just saved will appear in the `Recent Projects`-tab on the left. You can double-click it to open it. You can also navigate to the `.qgz`-file in your file explorer and double click on it. This will also launch QGIS and load the project. 

```{Tip}
Keeping your folder structure organised goes a long way in helping you work efficiently and without frustration.
__Remember__: Project files in QGIS are saved separately from the data and style files you are using in the project, which is why it is adviseable to keep all the files related to a project in a folder.
