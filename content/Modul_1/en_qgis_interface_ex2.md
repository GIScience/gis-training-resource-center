# Exercise 1: Understanding the QGIS Interface

__ðŸ”™[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__

## Aim of the exercise

QGIS is a complex program with lots of functions, and the interface can be confusing, especially for beginners. This exercise will get you familiar with the main toolbars, windows and panels in QGIS. You will create a new QGIS project and save it, and navigate through the different panels and toolbars.

The exercise covers: 

- Saving and loading a QGIS project
- Finding and using different toolbars
- Finding and using different panels 
- Moving panels around
- Activating new panels

## Data preparation

In this exercise, we will not be using any geodata. Instead, we will be learning how to navigate through the different interfaces and how to save and load a QGIS project. You can download the zipped template folder structure [here](https://nexus.heigit.org/repository/gis-training-resource-center/Modul_1/Modul_1_Exercise_1_Understanding_the_interface/Modul_1_Exercise_1_Understanding_the_interface.zip).

## Tasks

1. Create a new project. When opening QGIS, you will be greeted by 
the start layout, which shows the QGIS interface with no project loaded. On the 
left will be a panel with recent projects (this will probably be empty). To the 
right will be a news panel, showing posts from the QGIS blog, and beneath this 
is a `Project Templates` panel.

```
- In the `Project Templates` panel, __Double click on the `New Empty Project` option__ (it should be the only template visible). You will see a blank canvas in the main interface since there is no data loaded yet. 

2. Get to know the QGIS interface: Above the canvas, you will find the __toolbar__ with a lot of different functions. To the left and right of the canvas you will find the panels. In QGIS, you will mostly access tools by finding them in the __toolbars__ or __panels__. 

- Toolbars are at the top of the screen by default. They include the controls that let you switch between different ways of interacting with the interface. 
- Panels are at the sides of the screen by default. They include the file browser and layer navigation panels to the left of the screen. Other panels can be toggled to search and use processing tools. In the layer panel, you will see the data we will add later on.
On the right of the screen, you will most likely have the __Processing Toolbox__ panel. If it is missing for you, check out this [wiki page](content/Wiki/en_qgis_common_errors_and_Issues.md).

3. You can undock panels from their location by clicking and dragging the panel title. You can either dock it to another panel (it will appear as another tab), or turn it into its own window. You can also resize the panels. Try this by moving the Layer panel to the right ([Wiki Video](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_interface_wiki.html#move-and-arrange-toolbars)). 

```{TIP}
In QGIS, the interface may appear slightly different depending on your screen resolution. Occasionally, certain elements may be hidden due to default rendering settings. If you encounter this, try resizing the panels and exploring the various options and functions they provide. This can help ensure that all essential tools and features are easily accessible during your workflow.
```

4. QGIS has other panels you can use that aren't shown by default. Let's see how we can find and activate the other panels and toolbars.
- In the `View` menu, find the `panels` and `toolbar` options. Hovering over each will show a list of the available panels and toolbars, and which are activated. Give yourself a minute to look through the different toolbars and panels. There are lots of options but don't worry, you won't use most of them in this training. The panels we'll use the most are: 
- Browser
- Layers
- Layer Styling
- Processing Toolbox

5. Now, let's take a look at the toolbars. The toolbars we'll use the most are:  
- Attributes Toolbar
- Digitizing Toolbar
- Map Navigation Toolbar
- Project Toolbar
- Selection Toolbar
 

Take time to make yourself familiar with the different ways you can arrange the QGIS interface. Knowing where to find the different functions can save you a lot of time and frustration in the future!

6. Let's save the project now. Click on the save icon on the toolbar or open the  `Project` menu and choose `Save As...`
    1. Choose a location for the project file. An ideal place would be in the project subfolder in the template folder structure. Navigate to the folder called `Module_1_Exercise_1` and open the subfolder called `Project`. Select this location and give the QGIS project a name (for example: `QGIS_Training_Exercise_1`). The project will be saved as a `.qqz` file.
    2. Click `Save` 
     Close the QGIS application and reopen it.
7.  Close the QGIS application and reopen it. When QGIS restarts, the project we just saved will appear in the `Recent Projects` panel. You can double-click it to open it. You can also navigate to the `.qgz` file in your file explorer and double click on it. 
This will also launch QGIS and load the project. 

```{Tip}
Keeping your folder structure organised goes a long way in helping you work efficiently and without frustration.
```

```{Warning}
__Remember__: Project files in QGIS are saved separately from the data you are using in the project, which is why it is advisable to keep all the 
files related to a project in a folder.
```
