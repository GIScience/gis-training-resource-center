# What is GIS? (Theory)

## General information: 

- Geoinformatics in general focus on the __visualisation, organisation and processing of spatial data__. 

- Spatial analyses furthermore allow __to reveal circumstances and connections between spatial data features__: 

  - by making use of their spatial location, __information layers__ (or features within a layer) can be analyzed in regard to each other to obtain new information. 

## Why are spatial analyses important?

```
{Tip} Discuss in groups:
```
 - Situations in which you benefitted from spatial analyses.
 - Situations in which you could may be have benefitted from spatial analyses.
 - Main areas where you see potential for spatial analyses in your work.

## Introduction to GIS: 

### An informal definition

- Geographic Information System (GIS) uses maps to show __complex information__ clearly and efficiently. 
- For example, in an __emergency context__, GIS can be used to __visualize on a map__ what is happening, where, how many people are affected, and what their main needs are. 
- It can help to __summarize information__ from many different sources. 
- This helps peoples to __quickly understand__ the situation and make better informed decisions.

### A formal definition

- A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a __digital system that connects data to maps__. 
- It allows us to __collect, manage, analyse, and visualise data__ assigning them a position on __Earth’s surface__. 
- GIS reveals __deeper insights__ into data, clearly demonstrating patterns and helping us to understand __geographic context__. 
- Benefits include more __insightful analysis, improved communication, and ultimately better evidence-based decision-making__. 
- It’s rooted in __geography__, the field of science devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of the Earth. 
- GIS software can display __multiple types of data on a map__.

### GIS components

 - Hardware
 - Software
 - Data
 - People 
 - Workflows

### We use GIS for:

 - Creating interactive queries __(Querying)__
 - Analysing spatial information __(Spatial analysis)__
 - Editing and visualizing data in maps __(Editing)__
 - Present the results of all these operations __(Map making)__

### GIS in humanitarian responses

GIS has many applications in the __humanitarian field__:

 - Refugee/IDP camp planning
 - Mapping remote areas to facilitate access
 - Keep track of field operations
 - Support security decisions
 - Support operations planning
 - Identify areas most affected by disasters
  
```

# Paper maps and cartography 

### What is spatial analysis?

- Spatial analysis __studies entities and events__ using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties. 
- It includes a __variety of techniques__ to analyse geographic data. 
- Data can be added to a map as layers and they can interact with each other. 
- GIS enables you to work with these __layers__ to explore critically important questions and __find answers__ to those questions.

### An example from the past: John Snow’s Cholera map

In 1854 an __outbreak of cholera__ occurred in London, England. The most common theory was that the disease was spread through the air. Dr.John Snow believed that the danger was __in the water__. He made a map to analyse the __number of deaths__ in Soho per house block. He added the __location of water pumps__ on the map.
He found a __correlation__ between one specific water pump and the number of infections.

```

### GIS vs Cartography

- __Cartography__ is the study and practice of __making maps__.
- A GIS is a __modern extension__ of traditional cartography. 
- Both contain examples of a __base map__ to which additional data can be added. 
- The differences are that there is no limit to the __amount of additional data__ that can be added to a GIS map. 
- Cartographic maps are often extremely simplified as there are limits to the amount of data that can be physically and meaningfully stored on a small map. 
- GIS uses __analysis and statistics__ to present data in support of particular arguments which a cartographic map cannot do. 
- You can use GIS __for__ cartography.

## Examples for GIS created maps 

```
The battle against Malaria - Burundi -- Coordination in camps - Bangladesh
```
### Malaria 

- A fatal, mosquito-borne (vector) disease, killing over 620,000 people in 2020 (WHO).

### The battle against Malaria

__2 methods__ for the control of vector-borne diseases
-  Use of insecticide-treated nets
-  Insecticides for indoor residual spraying

### Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS)

This involves spraying the inside of houses, usually once or twice a year. However, in order to obtain significant community protection, a high level of coverage is required. IRS provides community protection when at least 85% of homes in a targeted area are
sprayed.

### Gis for coordination in the camps

- The mega refugee camp in Bangladesh in 2018
- __Navigational aid:__ 
to help field teams move around in such a huge camp without getting lost
- __Planning support:__ 
Population estimate, distribution of tents and infrastructure, risk assessment, …

## Geoprocessing Tools - Overview

![Geoprocessing icons](/fig/en_geoprocessing_icons.png)

![Geoprocessing tools](/fig/en_geoprocessing_tools.png)

```
{Tip} Example: Clip
```
Creates a __selection__ based on the spatial relationship between each feature in the input layer and the features in an additional layer.

Step by step:
- __Input Layer__: Layer from which the selection is clipped 
- __Overlay Layer__: Area of interest that the input layer will be clipped to 

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Clip](/fig/en_clip.png)

```
{Tip} Example: Buffer
```
- __Computes (a) buffer area(s)__ for all the features in an input layer, using a specified distance

Step by step:
- __Input Layer__: Layer around which features the buffer(s) are to be created
- __Distance__: Choose a value and unit (make sure that your input data is projected)
- __Segments__: Add value
- Mark __„Dissolve result“__ to automatically dissolve the buffer outputs 
- If individual buffers are needed, leave __blank__

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Buffer](/fig/en_buffer.png)

## Non-Spatial Joins in QGIS

- Choose __“Join Attributes by Field Value”__ Tool (use search tool):

- __Adds attributes__ of a non-spatial table to the layer

- Enables join using a __field/column__ that is present in both data sets

Step by step:
- Input layer: __Vector layer__ 
- Table field: Field/ column that exists in __both data sets__ (name of column in vector layer)
- Input layer 2: __Text/csv/xls data__ 
- Table field 2: Field/ column that exists in __both data sets__ (name of column in text/csv/xls)
- Join type: Select __„Take attributes of the first matching feature only (one-to-one)“__.
- Define __output layer name and destination__ or leave at temporary layer


 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Join attributes by field value](/fig/en_join_attributes_by_field_value.png)

```
{Tip} Hint
```
If a table join does not work via the “Join Attributes by Field Value” tool, a join can also be performed via the __layer properties__ (right-click, Properties) under the Join tab.

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Add vector join](/fig/en_add_vector_join.png)

## Spatial Joins in QGIS

Choose __“Join Attributes by Location”__ Tool:
- Adds __additional attributes__ of the join layer to the input layer based on the spatial relationship
- __Input Layer__: Dataset you want to enrich
- __Join layer__: Dataset with additional information/attributes
(you can specify which fields of the join layer should be added)

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Spatial joins](/fig/en_spatial_joins.png)

## A galaxy of tools
GIS comes with a __galaxy of tools__ that are constantly evolving. An increasing number of traditional tools are now capable of supporting geographic information (Excel, Power BI, Adobe Illustrator…)

### An overview: 

- __Mobile data collection tools__

The latter make it possible to collect data via mobile or tablet, and often to visualize and exchange it with other platforms according to a common format.

-  __Mapping tools__

These tools provide a simple vizualisation of geographic data, and allow for the production of maps.

- __GIS tools__

As opposed to the previous ones, these more advanced tools are very comprehensive and allow for advanced analyses to be carried out on the geographical components of data.

-  __Webmapping tools__

These tools make it possible to manipulate and create maps online in a very simple way directly in a web browser.
