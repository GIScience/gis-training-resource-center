These five trainings exercises are designed to support the training with the Sketch Map Tool. The exercises are conceptualized for different aspects of the tool, with different time demands and ifferent (GIS)-knowledge levels. All exercises contain clear instructions for trainers and participants and provide all necesary materials.
