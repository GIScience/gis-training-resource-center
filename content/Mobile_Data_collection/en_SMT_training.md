## Characteristics of the exercise 
#### Aim of this exercise:
Get familiar with the Sketch Map Tool and its whole workflow from map creation to the results.

#### Phase of participatory /community mapping 
preparing participatory mapping / facilitating participatory mapping/ analysing participatory mapping
#### Focus group (GIS-Knowlege Level)
planners/ facilitators as well as practitioners how are involved in the preparation of the filed campaign or collecting the data themselves (Beginners-level: no specific knowledge about QGIS /Umap required)
#### Type of trainings exercise:
This exercise can be used in online and presence training and is focused on an hands-on experience with the Sketch Map Tool
#### Estimated time demand for the exercise.
In general: 2:20 h till 2:45h (depending on number of groups)

```
? maybe as a tabel
Introduction: 10 min
Groupe exercise: 1: 35h 
•	15 min group reading and discussion the case
•	10 min for creating the maps 
•	buffer time for printing about 5 min 
•	15 min for marking 
•	10 min for digitalisation
•	20 min to open the files in QGIS or Umap 
•	20 min preparation of a short-presentation

Wrap-up (with presentations): 
- each group about 5 min to present 
- 10 min general discussion
- a bit buffer time for the change of the groups
```

Tip to shorten the time you can also just focus the hands-on-exploration on specific parts of the workflow. You can for example work with pre-marked maps to focus on the second half of the workflow or just focus on the first parts and show the final parts with prepared examples by sharing your screen. 

## Instructions for the trainers 
### Preparation and material 
- Online access and devices (PC) to be able to use the Sketch Map Tool to create maps online, upload and download them.
- Possibility to print the maps and smart phones to take the photos and a way to upload them to the Sketch Map Tool later. 
- Take a look and make yourself familiar on the provided material for the exercise and the Sketch Map Tool in general. 
- Prepare a board (it can be a white board /flipchart / or digital e.g. mirro-board) where the participants can add their findings.


```
Alternatives 
- If you conduct this training online, make sure your participants 
have a printer or are able to mark the maps digitally. 
- If you like to skip parts of the workflow, make sure you have alternative material (like preprinted, or already marked Sketch maps) prepared.
- If you like to adapt this exercise to your specific use case, create your own case-description. 
```



### Available Material: needs to be linked directly 
•	Introduction Slides about the Sketch Map Tool available
•	X EVCA-case studies as examples available 
•	Alternative files based on OSM- and satellite-based Sketch Maps from 5 regions.
o	Just the created maps for (pre-printing)
o	Pre-marked and photographed maps 
o	Geodata of the results and some pictures 


### During the exercise:  
#### Introduction: 
- Introduce the idea, the aim and the general workflow of the Skecht Map Tool beforehand 
- Provide access the needed material and build groups (in groups at least 3 people each to discuss together) best Groups of 3-6 participants)
- check-in with the groups if there are questions or problems.
- Prepare the presentation tool.

#### Wrap up: 
- All groups present their findings (each 5 min, make it short but show the maps they are talking about).
- Discuss Benefits as well as challenges and problems in the use of the sketch Map Tool 
- Time to for Open questions.

## Step-by step introduction for participants

If you expieriences any problems during your use of the [Sketch Map Tool](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) please take a look at the [Help page](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/help).



### 1.	Start discussion
Prepare and discuss in your small group.
- Take a look at information about you case-study.
- What do you like to map?
- Scroll through the help-page of the Sketch Map Tool

### 2.	Create a map in the Sketch Map Tool
- Open the [Sketch Map Tool](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) 
- Zoom in and select your map area: Try different zoom levels and change the orientation. 
- For the test create a map as A4.

### 3.	Mapping

- Discuss in your group what and how you would like to map, decide if you make larger areas, the streets, … so your mapping is similar, and the results can be compared.
- Or alternatively just map randomly different shapes, shapes, areas, lines, … of different sizes and different colours to explore how the digitalisation will look like. 

```
Print your maps and mark with real pens to experience the real use of the Sketch Map Tool. Or if it is not possible use alternatives with pre-printed maps or digital markings. Take a look at the mapping tips on the help page.
```

### 4.	Digitalise
- Take a photo of your map.
- Upload the photo to the Sketch Map Tool.
- Download the results to the Sketch Map Tool.

### 5.	Open your results in QGIS or umap
- Upload or open your results in QGIS or umap
- Take a look at the detected markings, compare it with your map which differences can you see?

### 6.	For Wrap-up: What are your experiences with the Sketch Map Tool? 
Make some notes, prepare a presentation and bring them back in the big group to wrap the exercise together
- Prepare a short presentation about your map area, there markings and how the results look like at the end.
- Problems / challenges
- Benefits 
- Open Questions
