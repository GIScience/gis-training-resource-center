# Sketch Map Tool Training

These five training exercises are designed to support the training with the Sketch Map Tool. The exercises are conceptualized for different aspects of the tool, with different time demands and different (GIS)-knowledge levels. All exercises contain clear instructions for trainers and participants and provide all necessary materials. [Introductory slides on the Sketch Map Tool](https://nexus.heigit.org/repository/gis-training-resource-center/mobile_data_collection/sketch_map_tool/PPP/Introduction_Sketch_Map_Tool_21_03.pptx) with facilitator notes are available, offering an overview of its features and functionality as well as highlighting  its value proposition and the benefits of using it. Additionally, printable factsheets are provided for each exercise, ensuring easy access to the essential information and instructions.

|__[1](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex1_.md)__| The __[“Workflow Exercise”](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex1_.md)__ guides you through the whole workflow of mapping with the Sketch Map Tool, from first ideas about what you like to map to the possible digital results. | Planners, Facilitators, and Practitioners (basic QGIS and uMap knowledge can be helpful) |2,5 h | 
| __[2](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex2_.md)__ | In the __[„Traffic Light exercise”](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex2_.md)__ you  can explore different base maps and discuss what makes a Sketch map good for mapping. |Planners, Facilitators, and Practitioners (no QGIS or uMap required) | 1,5 h |
|__[3](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex3_.md)__| In this __["Roleplay exercise"](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex3_.md)__ you can try participatory mapping with Sketch Maps yourself with a prepared scenario.  |Planners, Facilitators, and Practitioners (no QGIS or uMap required) | 1,5 h|
|__[4](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex4_.md)__| This __["Visualization Exercise"](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex4_.md)__ will guide you through the basic visualization of your Sketch Map Tool Results in either QGIS or uMAP.| Planners, Facilitators, Practitioners (basic QGIS or Umap knowledge can be helpful) |2,5 h |
|__[5](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex5_.md)__| In the __["Heat Map Exercise"](/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex5_.md)__ you will learn how to analyze your Sketch Map Tool Outputs by creating a heatmap. |Facilitators and Data analysts (Medium-advanced QGIS knowledge required)|1h|
