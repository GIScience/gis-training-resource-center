# Sketch Map Tool Exercise 2 - Traffic light

üößThis training platform and the entire content is under ‚ö†Ô∏èconstruction‚ö†Ô∏è and may not be shared or published! üöß

This exercise focuses on exploring the basemaps and discussing challenges of map literacy and orientation on the maps, as well as the characteristics, strengths, currency (possibility to update) and differences basemaps based on Satellite images or OSM.

## Characteristics of the exercise 
#### Aim of this exercise:
- Get familiar with the OSM and Satellite-image base maps and the Quality reports.
- Get a feeling how to assess the usability of a basemaps and possible problems.


#### Phase of participatory /community mapping 
preparing participatory mapping
#### Focus group (GIS-Knowlege Level)
planners/ facilitatiors  (Beginners-level: no knowledge required about QGIS)
#### Type of trainings exercise:
This exercise can be used in online and presence training and is focused on group discussions.
#### Estimated time demand for the exercise.
In general: about 1:15 h to 1:35 h (depending on number of groups)

| 10 min | 35 min - 10 min for creating the maps  - 25 min group discussion | Online mapping platform| - each group about 5 min to present  - 10 min general discussion - a bit buffer time for the change of the groups

To shorten the time you can work with prepared maps.

## Instructions for the trainers 

:::{dropdown} Trainers Corner
### Preparation and material 
- Online access and devices (PC) to be able to use the Sketch Map Tool and create maps online.
- Alternative print or share for each group one individual set of the Sketch Maps (OSM + satellite) and reports of one area OSM + satellite -map and the fitting report.
- Take a look and make yourself familiar on the provided material for the exercise and the Sketch Map Tool in general. 
- Prepare a board (it can be a white board /flipchart / or digital e.g. mirro-board) where the participants can add their findings.



### Available Material: needs to be linked directly 
- Introduction Slides with tips and a short basic introduction in the differences of satellite image /OSM
- 5 prepared examples of a set of mapping 



### During the exercise:  
#### Introduction: 
- Make sure everyone is familiar with the basic understanding about OSM and satellite maps. Introduce the aim of the exercise and the idea of the traffic lights and the analysis before you start the exercise!
- Provide access the needed material and build groups (in groups at least 3 people each to discuss together) best Groups of 3-6 participants)

#### Time for group work: 
- 10 min for creating the maps + reports & about 25 min for the questions.
- check-in with the groups if there are questions or problems.
- Prepare the presentation tool.


#### Wrap up: 
- All groups present their findings (each 5 min, make it short but show the maps they are talking about).
- Discuss Benefits as well as challenges and problems in the use of the sketch Map Tool 
- Time to for Open questions.

## What you need to know - background information
- Satelite data 
- OSM

If you expieriences any problems during your use of the [Sketch Map Tool](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) please take a look at the [Help page](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/help).



### 1.	Create the maps and reports
This step can be skipped with prepared examples.
- Open the Sketch Map Tool 
- Decide on an area fitting to your case study or you know very well or find interesting.
- Zoom in and select your map area: Try different zoom levels and change the orientation. 
- Create several maps of the same area with different oration, zoom level and basemaps. 


### 2.	Collect your insights to the following questions
Add your insights to a presentation or on a (digital) board to share it with other groups later.
- What are the main characterise of the area you see on the basemap? 
Describe separately both basemaps the one with the satellite image and the OSM data. 
- Could you orient yourself on the basemap? 
Are there points of interests / something you could use as a orientation point?
- Would you say the basemaps are suited for participatory mapping?
Reason your answer and think about participants that are not familiar with basemaps.  
- Which difference can you detect between satellite and OSM basemaps?
- In which uses cases would you prefer the OSM basemap? 
- In which uses cases would you prefer the Satellite basemap?
- What traffic light colour would you give the satellite and OSM basemap individually for this area?
- Discuss the OSM-Mapping-suitability-report:
- What is the overall result of the basemap? (Which colour of the traffic light?)
- What are your most important findings from the OSM-Mapping-suitability-report?
- Would it make sense to organise a maperton beforehand to improve the OSM data?



### 3.	Wrap-up: 

Make some notes and prepare yourself for a short presentation (with your maps) in the big group to wrap the exercise together
- Prepare your Presentation and decide who is going to present it.
- Think about Open Questions, as well as feedback to the exercise
