The [Sketch Map Tool](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) simplifies participatory mapping, by facilitating the creation and digitalisation of paper-based maps, the so-called Sketch Maps. This low-tech solution enables the offline collection of local knowledge and perceptions with pens and paper maps. Every SketchMap contains a basemap with OpenStreetMap data, which provides a scale and orientation. Upon uploading pictures of marked maps, the tool automatically digitizes and georeferences the markings, making it downloadable for integration into Geographic Information Systems. The Sketch Map Tool combines widely used, analogue mapping with digital analysis, fosters community involvement and the usability of gained results.

## The Sketch Map Tool and its use in the EVCA

The Enhanced Vulnerability and Capacity Assessment (EVCA) is a participatory process developed for communities to become more resilient through the assessment and analysis of the risks they face and the identification of actions to reduce these risks. The EVCA guidelines containes different tools in order no help National Societies to understand the dynamics of risk in a spedific community. 
In order to spatially assess and identify risk factors, the EVCA recommends to conduct a mapping activitiy throughout the process where community members jointly create a spatial map, hazard & exposure map and vulnerability & capacity map. Mapping is done with paper and pen and generally on blank paper. The Sketch Map Tool has great potential to support a sustainable participatory mapping process by digitalizing the process while keeping it simply.

[EVCA Guide](https://communityengagementhub.org/resource/evca-guide/)


As part of the efforts to digitize the EVCA Process, we prepared a customized training package on the Sketch Map Tool for digitalization of community mapping, that can be used by trainers throughout the regional EVCA Training of Trainers workshops.
