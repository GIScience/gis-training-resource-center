The [Sketch Map Tool](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) simplifies participatory mapping, by facilitating the creation and digitalisation of paper-based maps, the so-called Sketch Maps. This low-tech solution enables the offline collection of local knowledge and perceptions with pens and paper maps. Every SketchMap contains a basemap with OpenStreetMap data, which provides a scale and orientation. Upon uploading pictures of marked maps, the tool automatically digitizes and georeferences the markings, making it downloadable for integration into Geographic Information Systems. The Sketch Map Tool combines widely used, analogue mapping with digital analysis, fosters community involvement and the usability of gained results.
