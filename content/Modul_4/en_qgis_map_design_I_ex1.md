# Exercise 1: Flooding in Cambodia

This exercise is designed to apply the basics of map design from chapter 1, 2, and 3. Make sure to go through these chapter before starting this exercise. The corresponding subchapters and wiki-pages are linked if you need to refresh your memory.

Read the guide carefully and download the exercise data from the Nexus.

In the data folder, you will find several datasets.  The objective will be to create a comprehensive atlas with maps for each region in Cambodia detailing the flood extent, as well as road network (and affected roads) with all the necessary map elements. 

:::{dropdown} Context: Flooding in Cambodia  

The floodplains of the Mekong and the Tonle Sap System in Cambodia experience yearly flood pulses that bring nutrients and sustains the agriculture and fisheries. With the changing climate, the waterlevels of these floods have decreased, which leads to a reduced reverse flow, as well as a decrease in the flood duration of about 26 days (De Xun Cha et al. 2022). This trend will strain the food security in the region, affecting the livelihoods of a large part of the population. Combined with the decline of the yearly flood pulse, major flood events can cause national health crises, damage infrastructure, displace thousands of people and further exacerbate food security in the region.
In 2013, following continuous rainfall in September, the Mekong and Tonle Sap Deltas flooded, displacing 144 thousand people. In 2011, more than 200 thousand people have been displaced due to floods. As of 2023, Cambodia has experienced major flood events in 2020, 2022 and 2023 (IDMC 2023).

## Objectives

The data provided contains a shapefiles detailing the flood extent in October 2023, the road network, administrative boundaries, the Mekong and Tonle Sap Systems, as well as healthsites and airports. The goal will be to

## Step 1: Preparing the layers

1. Load the layers into QGIS and arrange them so you can see the road network on top of the flood extent. 
2. Arrange them in a way that no layer is blocking 

## Step 2: Set the symbology for the individual layers

1. First, let's style the administrative boundaries. We want to keep it simple and keep the polygon of the adm1 with a transparent filling, but with a thicker outline. On top of that layer, we want to see the adm2 boundaries, but with a thinner (or even dashed) outline
2. The flood extent needs to be immediatly recognizable. Choose a colour and filling style (Simple Fill or )

If you need inspiration on how to style certain elements of your map, make sure to check out the chapter [Examples for Food Map Design](/gis-training-resource-center/content/Modul_4/en_qgis_map_examples.md)
