## Instructions for the trainers

:::{dropdown} __Trainers Corner__ 

### Prepare the training

- Take the time to familiarise yourself with the exercise and the provided material.
- Prepare a white-board. It can be either a physical whiteboard, a flip-chart, or a digital whiteboard (e.g. Miro board) where the participants can add their findings and questions. 
- Before starting the exercise, make sure everybody has installed QGIS and has downloaded __and unzipped__ the data folder.
- Check out [How to do trainings?](/content/Trainers_corner/en_how_to_training.md#how-to-do-trainings) for some general tips on training conduction

### Conduct the training

__Introduction:__

- Introduce the idea and aim of the exercise.
- Provide the download link and make sure everybody has unzipped the folder before beginning the tasks.

__Follow-along:__

- Show and explain each step yourself at least twice and slow enough so everybody can see what you are doing, and follow along in their own QGIS-project. 
- Make sure that everybody is following along and doing the steps themselves by periodically asking if anybody needs help or if everybody is still following.  
- Be open and patient to every question or problem that might come up. Your participants are essentially multitasking by paying attention to your instructions and orienting themselves in their own QGIS-project.

__Wrap up:__

- Leave time for any issues or questions concerning the tasks at the end of the exercise.
- Leave some time for open questions.

### Availbale Data
Download all datasets and save the folder on your computer and unzip the file. The zip folder includes:
- `sen_admbnda_adm1_1m_gov_ocha_20190426.shp`: [Senegal boundary data (Admin level 1)](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/senegal-administrative-boundaries)
- `DI_Stat924.xls`: [Senegal Desinventar Sendai data](https://www.desinventar.net/DesInventar/profiletab.jsp?countrycode=sen) showing effects of disasters in Senegalese regions
- `sen_admpop_adm1_2020.csv`: Senegal administrative level 1 (r√©gion) 2019 [projection population statistics](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/senegal-population-statistics)

```{Hint}
All files still have their original names. However, feel free to modify their names if necessary to identify them more easily.
```

### Task
Create an overview of the effects of disasters in different regions of Senegal. Use non-spatial joins, table functions and different symbology.

```{Hint}
The projected coordinate system for Senegal is `EPSG:32628 WGS 84 / UTM zone 28N`
```

1. Load the Senegal administrative boundary layer (`sen_admbnda_adm1_1m_gov_ocha_20190426.shp`), as well as population per subnational unit (`sen_admpop_adm1_2020.csv`) and the Desinventar Sendai data of Senegal (`DI_Stat924.xls`) into QGIS.

2. Make sure to reproject the dataset with the administrative boundaries into UTM zone 28N. See the Wiki entry on [Projections](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_projections_wiki.md) for further information.

3. Conduct non-spatial joins based on regions listed in two datasets and the PCODE listed in these same sets. See the Wiki entry on [Non-spatial joins](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_non_spatial_joins_wiki.md) for further information.

4. First, add the total population of each administrative area to the shapefiles. Select the correct column that should be added (Hint: search for the column named `Total`).
5. Then, add the number of directly and indirectly affected people. Also select the correct columns that should be added (Hint: search for the column names `Directly affected` and `Indirectly Affected`).

6. Use the table functions to calculate the area of each region in square kilometres and the density of the population. See the Wiki entry on [Table functions](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_table_functions_wiki.md) for further information.
    - Create a new column/field named `"area_sqkm"` using the field calculator. Ensure decimal numbers are used as the field type. For the calculation use the expression: `$area / (1000 * 1000)`
    - Create another column/field named `"pop_per_sqkm"` with decimal numbers as field type. Use the expression: `"Total" / "area_sqkm"` for the calculation.

You can access the field calculator through your attribute table by activating ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) `Toggle editing mode` and clicking on this symbol ![](/fig/mActionCalculateField.png) to `Open field calculator`.

7. Now, we need to rename the `Indirectly Affected` and `Directly Affected` columns so they don't contain spaces. This ensures that the field calculator works properly. For this task we will use the tool `Rename field`.

5. Let us now determine the proportion of the population directly or indirectly affected in relation to the total population per region.
    - Use the field calculator. Use the expression: `"Indirectly Affected" / ("Total"/100)`
    - Use the field calculator. Use the expression:  `"Directly Affected" / ("Total"/100)`

6. Select a colour scheme using the `Symbology` to visualise the share of people directly affected in the different regions (Hint: `Categorized`).
    - Play around with different modes to find a useful colour/categorisation scheme for the visualisation.
    - Which regions are more and which are less directly affected? Are there any data gaps?

7. Export the map as a png (Hint: `Project, Import/Export, Export map to Image`).

8. Repeat the previous steps, but this time visualise the indirectly affected people in each region (Hint: `Categorized`, column `Indirectly affected`).

9. What differences can be observed between the regions directly affected and those indirectly affected?
