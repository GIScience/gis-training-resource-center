# Intermediate GIS Operations

This chapter introduces more intermediate GIS operations that you will most likely use in your work with QGIS. The first chapter covers spatial geoprocessing, such clipping, buffering, dissolving, spatial joins, or selecting by location. Spatial operations manipulate data according to their spatial characteristics and distribution. For example, you can select the hospitals within a certain distance of an area, or delete all the roads that are not within a part of the city. The second chapter introduces non-spatial geoprocessing, which includes table functions, non-spatial queries and joins. These operations manipulate the non-spatial information.
