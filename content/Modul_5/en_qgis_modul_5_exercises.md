These exercises touch on all the content of Modul 5.

## Spatial Geodataprocessing

* __[Healthsite distribution in Saint Louis region](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_spatial_tools_ex1.md):__ Becoming familiar with different types of spatial analysis and geoprocessing tools. Understand the process of discovering relationships and connections between features in spatial data.
    * Select by locatio
    * Select by expression
    * Buffer
    * Geodata Classification- Graduated
    * Geodata Classification- Categorized
* __[Calculate vulnerability index - Part 1](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_spatial_tools_ex2.md):__ We want to create an overview of different vulnerability indicators. From the Covid-19 risk indicators dataset we take `% permanent wall type`, `% permanent roof type` and `poverty incidence`. From the Uganda population statistics we calculate the `% of under fives` and `% of elderly`. We combine the data and we are now able to visualize the areas in Uganda that are most vulnerable.
    * Centroids
    * Move points
    * Reproject layer 
    * Fix geometries
    * Join attributes by location
    * 

## Non-Spatial Geodataprocessing

* __[Disaster effects in different regions of Senegal](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_non_spatial_tools_ex1.md):__ Becoming familiar with different types of non-spatial analysis and geoprocessing tools. Understand the process of discovering relationships and connections between features in spatial data.
    * Join Attribute by Field Value
    * Table functions
    * Field Calculator
    * Rename Field
    * Geodata Classification- Categorized
* __[Calculate vulnerability index - Part 2](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_non_spatial_tools_ex2.md):__ We want to create an overview of different vulnerability indicators. From the Covid-19 risk indicators dataset we take % permanent wall type, % permanent roof type and poverty incidence. From the Uganda population statistics we calculate the % of under fives and % of elderly. We combine the data and we are now able to visualize the areas in Uganda that are most vulnerable.
    * Join attributes by field value
