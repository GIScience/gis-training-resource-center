# Exercises Module 6 - Data Analysis with QGIS

These exercises cover all the content from Module 6.

| Exercise| Description |Focus Group|Estimated time|

| __[Exercise 1: Calculate vulnerability index - Part 1](/content/Module_6/en_qgis_spatial_tools_ex2.md)__ | We want to create an overview of different vulnerability indicators. From the Covid-19 risk indicators dataset we take `% permanent wall type`, `% permanent roof type` and `poverty incidence`. From the Uganda population statistics, we calculate the `% of under fives` and `% of elderly`. By combining the data, we are now able to visualise the areas in Uganda that are most vulnerable. | Spatial Processing | 3 hours |
| __[Exercise 1: Calculate vulnerability index - Part 2](/content/Module_5/en_qgis_non_spatial_tools_ex2.md)__ | We want to create an overview of different vulnerability indicators. From the Covid-19 risk indicators dataset we take % permanent wall type, % permanent roof type and poverty incidence. From the Uganda population statistics we calculate the % of under fives and % of elderly. We combine the data and we are now able to visualise the areas in Uganda that are most vulnerable. | Non-spatial Processing | 3 hours |
