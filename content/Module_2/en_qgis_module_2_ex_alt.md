## Instructions for the trainers

:::{dropdown} __Trainers Corner__ 

### Prepare the training

- Take the time to familiarise yourself with the exercise and the provided material.
- Prepare a white-board. It can be either a physical whiteboard, a flip-chart, or a digital whiteboard (e.g. Miro board) where the participants can add their findings and questions. 
- Before starting the exercise, make sure everybody has installed QGIS and has downloaded __and unzipped__ the data folder.
- Check out [How to do trainings?](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Trainers_corner/en_how_to_training.html#how-to-do-trainings) for some general tips on training conduction

### Conduct the training

__Introduction:__

- Introduce the idea and aim of the exercise.
- Provide the download link and make sure everybody has unzipped the folder before beginning the tasks.

__Follow-along:__

- Show and explain each step yourself at least twice and slow enough so everybody can see what you are doing, and follow along in their own QGIS-project. 
- Make sure that everybody is following along and doing the steps themselves by periodically asking if anybody needs help or if everybody is still following.  
- Be open and patient to every question or problem that might come up. Your participants are essentially multitasking by paying attention to your instructions and orienting themselves in their own QGIS-project.

__Wrap up:__

- Leave time for any issues or questions concerning the tasks at the end of the exercise.
- Leave some time for open questions.

## Available Data

:::{card}
:class-card: sd-text-center 
:link: https://nexus.heigit.org/repository/gis-training-resource-center/Module_2/Module_2_Exercise_5_The_World.zip

__Download all datasets [here](https://nexus.heigit.org/repository/gis-training-resource-center/Module_2/Module_2_Exercise_5_The_World.zip), save the folder on your computer and unzip the file.__ 

:::

The folder is called “Module_2_Exercise_5_The_World" and contains the whole [standard folder structure](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_projects_folder_structure_wiki.md#standard-folder-structure) with all data in the input folder and the additional documentation in the documentation folder.

- [World Countries (Generalized)](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/2b93b06dc0dc4e809d3c8db5cb96ba69_0/explore) (Polygon/Shapefile)
- [Significant Earthquake Dataset](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ngdc.mgg.hazards:G012153) (CSV)
- [Global Power Plant Dataset](https://datasets.wri.org/dataset/globalpowerplantdatabase) (Points/GeoPackage)

## Tasks

::::{margin}
:::{tip}
Make sure to __unzip__ the exercise folder before beginning the tasks. Otherwise, you will not be able to import the datasets into QGIS.
:::
::::

1. Open QGIS and create a [new project](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_projects_folder_structure_wiki.md#step-by-step-setting-up-a-new-qgis-project-from-scratch) by clicking on `Project` -> `New`

2. Once the project is created save the project in the `/Project`-subfolder in the `/Module_2_Exercise_5_The_World`/. In the top bar, click on `Project` -> `Save as` and navigate to the folder. Name the project “Module_2_Ex_5_The_World”.


3. Load the shape file `World_countries_generalized.shp` into your project by drag and drop ([Wiki Video](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.md#open-vector-data-via-drag-and-drop)). Or click on `Layer`-> `Add Layer`-> `Add Vector Layer`. Click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to "World_countries__generalized". Select the file and click `Open`. Back in QGIS click `Add` ([Wiki Video](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.md#open-vector-data-via-layer-tab)).

    ``` {Attention}
    With both methods, you need to select the file with the ending `.shp`! A [shapefile consists of several files](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Module_2/en_qgis_geodata_concept.html#shapefile-structure) that are referring to each other. The file that holds the geometry information is the file ending with `.shp`.
    ```

4. Load the GeoPackage file `global_power_plant_database_nuclear.gpkg` into the QGIS project. You can use one of the methods used in the previous step: Either drag and drop ([Wiki Video](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.html#open-vector-data-via-drag-and-drop)) the file or click on `Layer`-> `Add Layer`-> `Add Vector Layer`. Click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to `/data/input/`. Select the file and click `Open`. Back in QGIS click `Add`([Wiki Video](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.html#open-vector-data-via-layer-tab)).

    ```{Note}
    GeoPackage files can contain multiple files, and even whole QGIS projects. When you load such a file in QGIS, a window will appear in which you have to select the files you want to load in your QGIS project.
    ```

5. Next, we want to load the file `Significant_earthquake_data.txt` into QGIS. Since this is vector data in text format, we need to follow specific steps ([Wiki Video](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.html#open-csv-data-in-qgis)).
    * Click on `Layer`-> `Add Layer`-> `Add Delimited text Layer`. Click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to `Significant_earthquake_data.txt` in the `data/input/`-subfolder. Select the file and click `Open`.
    * In the window "Data Source manager| Delimited Text" in QGIS open the dropdown menu `File Format` and check `Custom delimiter` and `Tab`
    * Open the dropdown menu `Geometry definition`. Make sure the option `Point coordinates` is checked. Furthermore, select for `X field` “LONGITUDE” and for `Y field` “LATITUDE”.
    * Select the coordinate reference system (CRS) "EPSG:4326-WGS 84".
    * Click `Add`.
    ```{Note}
    When loading vector data in text format like .csv or .txt in QGIS, these data has to have latitude and longitude columns. 
    * `X field` =“LONGITUDE” 
    * `Y field` = “LATITUDE”.
    ```

    width: 600px
    name: ex5_import_text_layer
    align: center
    ---
    ```

6. In the layer panel on the left, arrange the three layers in a practical order. Remember the [Layer Concept](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_layer_concept_wiki.md). The countries-layer should sit below the earthquake and power plant layers.

You can also move the map by clicking on the map canvas and holding <kbd>Space</kbd>. This will automatically activate the hand-tool while pressing the space bar. Scrolling with your mouse(pad) also lets you zoom in and out in the map canvas. Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> on windows, or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on MacOS, allows you to zoom in smaller steps.
:::
::::

7. Interact with the map and explore the data sets. Use the zoom tool and move the map. Where can you find a lot of earthquakes and where are most of the power plants located?

::::{margin}
```{Tip}
If you see `*` before the name of your project on the top left corner of QGIS this means there are unsaved changes in your project. Save your progress!
```
::::

8. Save your project by clicking on the ![](/fig/mActionFileSave.png) or use the hotkey combination <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.

9. Your results should look something like this:
