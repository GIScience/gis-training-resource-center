# About
This QGIS training is made by people who believe GIS can help humanitarians to serve people in need better. :heart:
The idea for this training platform originated from a group of people from the German Red Cross, British Red Cross and Netherlands Red Cross. :mega:
A group of dedicated student assistants and employees of the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT) are working to put together the materials on this platform. :hammer:
