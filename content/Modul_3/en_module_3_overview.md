# Basic GIS Operations

The third module addresses operations and data manipulation that GIS practitioners will undertake 
frequently. The first chapter teaches the process of digitisation, which is the process of creating 
geodata, either from existing images, or maps, or from your own knowledge. After data collection, 
digitisation let's you prepare the collected data for spatial analysis in QGIS. It is also useful to 
communicate the spatial distribution of phenomenons or to simply show the collected data on a map. Next, 
the second chapter focuses on the classification of geodata. Spatial data can have a lot of information 
stored in the attribute table and the classification of geodata puts this information into distinct 
classes. Through this classification, we can gain new insights and it let's us visualise geographic data on 
maps. The third chapter, covers selecting and querying geodata. For example, you can select all data 
entries that are under a certain distance from a point, or you could simply select data based on specific 
values and see their spatial distribution.
