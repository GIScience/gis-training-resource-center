# Geodata Classification

**Data Styling/ Classification**

Data classification is the process that allows you to assign different symbols to features. i.e. different objects in the same layer based on their properties. This allows users of the map to quickly see the properties of numerous features.

In QGIS, a style is a way of cartographic visualization that takes into account a layerâ€™s individual and thematic features. It encompasses basic characteristics of symbology, such as the color and presence of fill, outline parameters, the use of markers, scale-dependent rendering, layer transparency, and interactions with other layers.
