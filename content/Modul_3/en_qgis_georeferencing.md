# Georeferencing 

Georeferencing in QGIS is the process of aligning a raster image, such as a scanned map or aerial photograph, to a known coordinate system so that it can be used in spatial analysis. This involves assigning real-world coordinates to the image by identifying control points on the raster that correspond to known locations on the earth, often using existing vector layers or coordinate grids as a reference.

In QGIS, the Georeferencer tool is used for this process. Users manually place control points on the raster image and match them to corresponding locations in a reference dataset. The software then uses these points to transform the image, adjusting its scale, rotation, and position to accurately overlay it with other geospatial layers. Georeferenced images become valuable for digitizing features and conducting spatial analyses within a GIS.
