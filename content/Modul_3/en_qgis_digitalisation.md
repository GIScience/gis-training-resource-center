# Digitisation



__ðŸ”™[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__

Digitisation is the process of converting geographic data from maps or images into a digital form commonly represented as vector data.
During this procedure, spatial information from maps or images is traced, forming points, polylines, or polygons.
Proficiency in digitisation stands as a cornerstone for GIS specialists. It empowers them to convert spatial information into a digital format, facilitating more efficient data manipulation compared to traditional methods of interpreting images or paper maps.

##  Digitising in QGIS

The digitisation of geodata is a useful method to collect and modify your own data. The following subchapter will explain how to digitise data within QGIS step by step.

### Digitisation toolbars

First, you need to check if the 'Digitizing Toolbox` is activated. To do that 
* Click on the `View` tab in the menu bar and click `Toolbars`. Check if the `Digitizing` and `Advanced Digitizing` toolbox is activated.

The normal digitisation toolbar offers all the necessary functions . However, for everything that goes above just creating new features and deleting features, the Advanced Digitalization toolbar is needed. 
The Advanced Digitalization toolbar allows you to move features, delete parts of features, and much more. All functions are listed in the two tables below.

 ## Data Creation

To digitise data for a new dataset you always have to start with creating the dataset before filling it with digitised data.

<video width="100%" controls src="https://github.com/GIScience/gis-training-resource-center/raw/main/fig/qgis_create_layer.mp4"></video>

1. `Layer` --> `Create Layer` -> `New GeoPackage Layer` or `New Shapefile Layer`
2. Click on ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to the folder where you want to save the dataset.
3. `File encoding`: Make sure this is set to UTF-8
4. `Geometry type`: Select the type of feature you want to digitise e.g. points or lines.
5. Under `Additional dimension` you should always make sure that you check `None`. Except if there is the possibility to collect the Z-values (elevation) as well. But this is mostly not the case.
6. CRS dropdown: Select the EPSG/CRS you want to set for the new layer. By default, the QGIS selects the project CRS. If you want to change the CRS click on ![](/fig/mIconProjectionEnabled.png).
7. Under `New Field` you can add columns to the new layer. 
    * `Type`: Select the data type the column will have e.g. `Text`, `Whole number`, `Decimal Number`, `Date`.
    ```{Note} 
    The number of options depends on the data format the layer will have. GeoPackage, for example, offers far more options than the Shapefile format.
    ```
    * Click on ![](/fig/mActionNewAttribute.png) to add the new column to the `Fields List`.
8. Click `OK`

```

```{attention} 
An important concept to understand before starting to add data to datasets is, that, whenever you make changes to a dataset other than styling, you have to put it in editing mode. This is done by selecting the layer and clicking on![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) `Toggle Editing`. Now, the buttons for many functions of the digitisation toolbar are clickable. 
After you are done manipulating the layer click on ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) `Save Layer Edits` to save your edits. 

```

### Creating point data

To digitise points, you either need to have an existing point layer or you need to create a new point layer (see [Digital Data Creation](/content/Modul_3/en_qgis_digitalisation.md#digital-data-creation) above).

1.	Select the point layer you want to add data to in the Layer panel.
2.	Go to the digitisation toolbar and click on![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) `Toggle Editing`. No the layer is in the editing mode.
3.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionCapturePoint.png). 
4.	Left-click on the feature you want to digitise.
5.	Once you click, a window will appear `[Your Layer Name]- Feature Attribute`. Here you can add the information about this feature to the different columns, based on the attribute table of the layer.
5.	Once you are done with digitalization ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) to save your edits.
6.	Click again on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) to end the editing mode.

```

#### Creating line data

Creating line data works in the same way as creating point data (see above). First, you must create a new line layer or use an existing one. 

```{attention} 
If you create a new line layer, remember to change the geometry type into lines.
```
1.	Select the line layer you want to add data to in the Layer panel
2.	Go to the digitisation toolbar and click on![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png). Now, the layer is in the editing mode.
3.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionCaptureLine.png). 
4.	To digitalise line features, click along the line. When you are done, right-click on the last point of the line to finish the feature.
5.	A window will appear `[Your Layer Name]- Feature Attribute`. Here you can add the information about this feature to the different columns, based on the attribute table of the layer.
6.	Once you are done with digitisation, click on ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) `Save Layer Edits` to save your edits.
7.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) `Toggle Editing` again to end the editing mode.

<video width="100%" controls src="https://github.com/GIScience/gis-training-resource-center/raw/main/fig/Creat_line_feature.mp4"></video>


#### Creating polygon data

The creation of polygon layers works in the same way as for point and line data.

1.	Select the polygon layer you want to add data to in the Layer panel.
2.	Go to the digitisation toolbar and click on![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png). Now, the layer is in the editing mode.
3.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionCapturePolygon.png). 
4.	To digitise polygon features, left-click around the area you want do digitize. When you are done, right-click on the last point of the area to finish the feature.
5.	A window will appear `[Your Layer Name]- Feature Attribute`. Here you can add the information about this feature to the different columns, based on the attribute table of the layer.
6.	Once you are done with digitisation ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) to save your edits.
7.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) `Toggle Editing` again to end the editing mode.

## Data Editing

In some cases, you might want to modify or correct vector datasets because of inaccuracies. Editing vector data is done with the same toolbar as for the creation of vector data. This chapter will cover the change of geometries of data, not covering changing data in the attribute table.

For all cases...

1. You have to select the layer you want to edit.
2. Click on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) to activate editing mode.
3. Do your changes.
4. Save your edit by clicking on ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png).
5. Click again on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) to end the editing mode.

```{Tip} 
You can use the ![](/fig/mActionUndo.png) & ![](/fig/mActionRedo.png) buttons to reverse changes easily.

Note that this is only possible __before__ you save the changes.
```

### Deleting features

1.	Select the line layer you want to add data to in the Layer panel.
2.	Go to the digitisation toolbar and click on![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) `Toggle Editing`. 
3.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionSelectRectangle.png) and select the feature you want to delete (see [wiki](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_spatial_queries_wiki.html#manual-selection)).
4.	Once you have selected the features, click on ![](/fig/mActionDeleteSelectedFeatures.png) to delete the feature.
5.	Once you are done with editing, click on ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) to save your edits.
6.	Click again on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) to end the editing mode.

### Moving features

There are multiple methods to move features. Here we show the method that works the same for point, line, and polygon features.
To do this, you need the Advanced Digitisation Toolbox.


1.	Select the line layer you want to add data to in the Layer panel.
2.	Go to the digitisation toolbar and click on![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png). 
3.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionMoveFeaturePoint.png) and click on the feature you want to move. Then, click on the location where you want to move the feature.
4.	Once you are done with editing, click on ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) to save your edits.
5.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) again to end the editing mode.

<video width="100%" controls src="https://github.com/GIScience/gis-training-resource-center/raw/main/fig/move_feature_geometry.mp4"></video>

### Modifying geometries

1.	Select the line layer you want to add data to in the Layer panel.
2.	Navigate to the digitisation toolbar and click on![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png). 
3.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionVertexToolActiveLayer.png).
4.	Now you can now move every vertex (corner) of a feature. Click on the vertex/corner you want to move and then click on the location where you want to move the vertex to.
5.	Once you are done with editing click on ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) to save your edits.
6.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) again to end the editing mode.

### Adding a ring to a polygon feature

A ring in QGIS is a part inside a polygon that is not part of the polygon. Image a polygon representing a lake. The ring is an island in the lake. For a better understanding, watch the video below.

1.	Select the line layer you want to add data to in the Layer panel.
2.	Go to the digitisation toolbar and click on![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png). 
3.	Click on ![add ring icon](/fig/mActionAddRing.png).
4.	Create a ring by clicking the area you want to exclude. Right-click to close the ring.
5.	Once you are done with editing, click on ![](/fig/mActionSaveEdits.png) to save your edits.
6.	Click on ![](/fig/mActionToggleEditing.png) again to end the editing mode.

## Digitisation Errors in QGIS

Positional errors are inevitable when data are manually digitised. The most common examples include undershooting and overshooting.  When your coordinates do not connect as they should, and overshooting, when the lines go past where they should. Often these errors are not visible unless you zoom in quite a bit on the coordinates. Setting a fuzzy tolerance (snapping tolerance) is used to reduce undershoots and overshoots. The snapping tolerance is the minimum tolerated distance between nodes, lines and/or vertices.
