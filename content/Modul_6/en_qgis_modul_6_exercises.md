__ðŸ”™[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__

These exercises touch on all the content of module 6.

* __[Calculate vulnerability index - Part 1](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_spatial_tools_ex2.md):__ We want to create an overview of different vulnerability indicators. From the Covid-19 risk indicators dataset we take `% permanent wall type`, `% permanent roof type` and `poverty incidence`. From the Uganda population statistics, we calculate the `% of under fives` and `% of elderly`. By combining the data, we are now able to visualize the areas in Uganda that are most vulnerable.
    * Centroids
    * Move points
    * Reproject layer
    * Fix geometries
    * Join attributes by location


* __[Calculate vulnerability index - Part 2](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_non_spatial_tools_ex2.md):__ We want to create an overview of different vulnerability indicators. From the Covid-19 risk indicators dataset we take % permanent wall type, % permanent roof type and poverty incidence. From the Uganda population statistics we calculate the % of under fives and % of elderly. We combine the data and we are now able to visualize the areas in Uganda that are most vulnerable.
    * Join attributes by field value
    * Table functions
    * Field Calculator
    * Geodata Classification- Graduated
