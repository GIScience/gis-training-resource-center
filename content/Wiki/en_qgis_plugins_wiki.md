There are numerous extensions for QGIS, also called plugins, which provide extended functionalities. Usually, if you have a specific task and QGIS does not have the right functionality, look for a plugin. You google or search in the plugin window. 

## Installation of plugins

To install a plugin `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install Plugins…` -> `All` -> Search for the plugin -> `Install Plugin`

```{Tip}
If you cannot find a specific extension, check your capitalisation and correct use of spaces. If you still cannot find an extension, you may need to allow the experimental extensions in the options (see below).
```

## Manage Plugins

If you are currently not using installed plugins it might be usefull to deacticate these plugins to avoid crowded toolbars and to reduce open panels.

## Allow experimental extensions

Experimental extensions are either still under development, or they are obsolete extensions that are no longer further optimised/adapted for the newer versions of QGIS. Nevertheless, the use of experimental extensions can be useful:

* Specific functions are not supported in any other extension.
* Alternative if there are problems with another extension.
* A tutorial makes use of a specific extension.

```{Tip}
Due to the often missing optimization for the used QGIS version, experimental extensions may cause more error messages or other problems up to a crash of QGIS. Experimental extensions should therefore only be activated for use and then deactivated again. In addition, make sure that the current working progress is saved to avoid data loss when QGIS crashes.
