Categorized classification in QGIS groups spatial data into distinct categories based on specific attributes. This classification enhances the organization and interpretation of geospatial information for clearer insights.

Categorized classification is usually used for __nominal__ and __ordinal__ scaled data.

| Data Scale | Definition| Example | Typical Data Format |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nominal Scale                | Categories without inherent order or ranking             | Land cover types, districts, livelihood zones | Text ("Desert") or Integer (5)      |
| Ordinal Scale                | Categories with a meaningful order or ranking            | Ranks (e.g., low, medium)   | Text ("high") or Integer (5)      |
