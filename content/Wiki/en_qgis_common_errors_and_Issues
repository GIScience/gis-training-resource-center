# QGIS common errors and issues

Here we are collecting common QGIS errors and issues as general QGIS training support.

## Common QGIS errors

- A layer is not displayed in QGIS. 

  - Solution: 
  Right click on the corresponding layer and activate the *Zoom to layer* function in the pop-up window.

- A layer window has disappeared in QGIS.

  - Solution:

 Open in the main tab *View*, in the pop-up window select *Panels* and in the sub-window activate *Browser*.

- Layers that should actually be in the same position are not on top of each other.

  - Solution:

These sort of problems are usually due to a) mismatching KBS in layers and project, or b) an incorrect reprojection. 

 a) First check the layer properties (right-click on the corresponding layer, select in the pop-up window *Properties*, in the next pop-up-window select *Information* and check which projection is defined there under the entry *Coordinate Reference System (CRS)* and additionally in the status bar at the bottom right which project KBS/CRS is set there. Then correct any discrepancies by reprojecting the layers or changing the setting of the KBS/CRS project. 

b) When reprojecting, follow exactly the procedure described in the Wiki under Projections (ergänzen). Errors often occur if KBS is set and no reprojection tool is used. If you suspect that your reprojection has gone wrong, delete all affected layers from GIS, reload the data and then reproject.

- Sometimes the reference is not really clear in the exercise text: goes it to the attribute table of the layer or to the PDF table concerning the areas affected by the flood.

- After each important exercise step a visualization of the result may be helpful, f. ex. for visualizing the mentioned point layer.

- I could make sense to place the reference to the coding a little bit earlier in the text to avoid that it is not overlooked or "forgotten" during the exercise.
- There are two variants of *Join attributes by location* in the toolbox, so may help to enter a note here. 
- When converting tables to csv, it could make sense to add a note in the text whether you are converting for Mac or Win computers and that from a multi-page Excel only the first page will be read out.
