## Single symbol classification


__ðŸ”™[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__

By default, QGIS visualizes all layers in the `Single symbol` setting. This means all the features of a layer are visualised the same. In this setting, you can change many parameters like colour or opacity __but you can not classify any data!__
