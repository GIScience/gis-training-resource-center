# Web & mobile GIS applications

You can use GIS through __multiple applications__, from desktop software, to 
online platforms, to mobile apps. At a basic level, you can perform limited 
geospatial tasks with apps such as __Google Earth__ or __Google Maps__.
As a GIS professional, you will mostly use __desktop software__, which could 
be either proprietary (requiring a license, e.g. ESRI's ArcGIS) or open-source 
(available to use for free, e.g. QGIS). However, web applications can be relevant 
for obtaining data or to share data and maps with others.

## Web apps overview

Here are some online GIS platforms and tools you should be aware of; we'll use 
some of them later in the training. 

- __[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)__: 
An __open geographic database__ updated and maintained by a community of volunteers 
via open collaboration. It works using a tag system (each feature is categorized 
through tags).
- __[uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/)__: 
An online GIS application based on OpenStreetMap. You can upload standard geodata 
formats and do nice visualisation. Umap is very good for sharing maps and 
presenting basic interactive maps.
- __[Felt](https://felt.com/)__: 
Felt is similar to uMap but even prettier. An __easy tool__ to create maps. You 
can draw, create features and upload shapefiles. Additionally, you can connect it to your 
QGIS with a plugin. In this way, you can use Felt for collaborative work.
- __[Wikimapia](https://wikimapia.org/)__: 
Online editable map service. Updated and maintained by contributors all over the 
world. It uses __local knowledge__, making it particularly useful in remote areas.
- __[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)__:
Limited, but it allows you to upload layers, create and export features, __share 
simple maps__.

## Mobile apps overview 

Mobile GIS apps are important for navigation and mobile data collection. 
Some of the most important free and open-source apps are listed below. 

- __[Qfield](https://docs.qfield.org/)__: Through QFieldCloud, you can __open 
your QGIS projects__ on Qfield on your mobile device. Any edit made on the map 
in the app can then be synced and displayed in QGIS.
- __[OsmAnd](https://osmand.net)__: Using OSM basemap, itâ€™s a good app for 
__offline navigation__. You can upload `.kml` files to display on the map, as well 
as recording your trips and then exporting them.
- __[GeoODK](http://geoodk.com/index.htm)__: Combines __OpenDataKit (ODK) with a geo app__. 
You can collect data through ODK surveys and display them on a map, in addition 
to easily creating polygons and adding information to them.
- __[KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org)__: KoboToolbox is an open-source suite designed for efficient data
collection and analysis, especially in challenging environments. It supports online and offline data collection via 
mobile devices and web forms, and offers an intuitive form builder for creating complex surveys. It includes features 
like real-time data viewing, data export.
