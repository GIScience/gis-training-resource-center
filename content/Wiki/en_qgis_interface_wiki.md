# QGIS Interface

## Overview of QGIS Interface

1. __Layers List / Browser Panel:__ The layers list shows all layers/files that are loaded in the project. You can show/hide layers and set other properties.
2. __Toolbars:__  Toolbars are shortcuts to execute frequently used commands. For example, there are special toolbars for vector and raster files, but also general ones for saving your project, etc. The toolbar contains, among other things, a list of all the commands you can use. The toolbar also contains the toolbox, which is used later in many of the wiki videos.

3. __Map view:__ The map view is the central component of every GIS programme. This is where the geodata are displayed. The map view has a projection which does not always have to correspond to the projection of the layers.
4. __Status bar:__ In the status bar you will find central information about the current map view. Here you can set the projection of the map view and the scale. You can read the coordinates of the mouse pointer and thus quickly find out the coordinates of points on the map. You can rotate your map view, e.g. if you want to create a map facing south.
5. __Side Toolbar__: You may see a side toolbar. This is another way to easily open vector and raster files in QGIS.
6. __Locator bar:__ Here you can search for tools and layers. If you don't know where to find a tool, you can try here.
