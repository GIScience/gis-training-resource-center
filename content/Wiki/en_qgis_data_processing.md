# Data Processing

QGIS allows you to process and modify the datasets loaded into your QGIS in various ways. In general, there are two types of processing: spatial and non-spatial. Spatial processing modifies the data based on their spatial relationship with features in other layers. Non-spatial processing modifies the data based on the values in their attribute table. 

:::{Admonition} Be careful when modifying the original datasets
:class: Tip

If you modify the Attribute table or the features in a dataset you imported into your QGIS project, the original dataset will be modified. To make sure to keep the original dataset as it is, make sure to create a copy before doing any changes.
