## Manual selection

- Select the features manually in the __attribute table__ by clicking on it.
- Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while selecting features lets you select multiple features at once.

:::{dropdown} Example: Manually select countries with the attribute table

## Select by expression

The `Select by Expression` tool lets you build an expression to select features of a layer. For example, you can select specific attributes, or select features where the value of an attribute in a specific range.

1. Open the attribute table and select the `Select by Expression`-tool.

2. The expression builder will open.

### Comparison operators 
- `>`, `<`, `=`, `!=`

:::{dropdown} Example: Select all cities with more than 20 million inhabitants in 2015: `"2015" > 20000`

:::

### Special operators

- `LIKE`

:::{dropdown} Example: Select all countries in Asia: `"continent" LIKE 'asia'`

### Logical operators
- `AND`, `OR`
- Can be used to combine different queries or criteria.

:::{dropdown} Example: Cities, not having a population of one million inhabitants in 1950, had surged to over 10 million inhabitants by 2015: `"1950" < 1000 AND "2015" > 10000`

## Complex Expressions

It is also possible to add expressions that chain different requirements. In this case do not forget to put brackets around individual parts of the expression such as:
```

```

### Save selected features as a new file

- `Layer-Properties` -> `Export` -> `Save only selected features`

:::{dropdown} Example: Export selected features as a new file
