## Select by expression
### Comparison operators 
- `>`, `<`, `=`, `!=`

:::{dropdown} Example: Select all cities with more than 20 million inhabitants in 2015: `"2015" > 20000`
:open:

:::

### Special operators
- `LIKE`

:::{dropdown} Example: Select all countries in Asia: `"continent" LIKE 'asia'`

:::

### Logical operators
- `AND`, `OR`
- Can be used to combine different queries or criteria.

:::{dropdown} Example: Cities, not having a population of one million inhabitants in 1950, had surged to over 10 million inhabitants by 2015: `"1950" < 1000 AND "2015" > 10000`

### Save selected features as a new file
- `Layer-Properties` -> `Export` -> `Save only selected features`

:::{dropdown} Example: Export selected features as a new file
