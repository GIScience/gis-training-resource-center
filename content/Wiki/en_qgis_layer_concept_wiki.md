# Layer Concept

🚧This training platform and the entire content is under ⚠️construction⚠️ and may not be shared or published! 🚧

Geoinformation systems (GIS) visualize data by stacking layers on top of one another to create maps. Every layer represents one set of information.
This is a vital concept to understand since analysis, as well as visualisation of data, is based on it.

## Layer properties

Each layer has additional properties that you can view and customise. The most important are 

* __Information:__ An overview of the layer name, file format, storage location, spatial extent, number of features (objects),...
* __Symbology:__ Display mode of the layer, style, transparency,...
