# Geodata and Geodata processing
**Competences:**
* Data import
* Geo features and attributes
* Feature selection
* Basemap selection

In this chapter, we will have a close look at how to work with geodata in QGIS. 
Since vector data is the primary geodata type you will work with at the beginning 
of your GIS career, we will focus on vector geodata.

## Geodata mananagemnet 

Working with geodata is not like working with data in programs like Microsoft 
Excel or Word. Whenever you load an image in a Word file, the file will contain 
the image. If you delete the image on your computer, the Word file will still 
contain a copy of the image. 

This is not the case in QGIS! When you load geodata into QGIS, the system only 
establishes a link to the location where the data is stored on your computer. 
This means your QGIS project __does not contain__ the geodata, it only links to 
it. If you load data in your QGIS project and you change the location of the 
data or delete it, the data is no longer available in your QGIS project and you 
will get an error when you open it. 

Because you are working directly with the source data, rather than a copy, 
whenever you edit data in QGIS the changes replace the source data and can not 
be reversed. If you plan to make changes to your data, you should make a copy of 
it first so that you always have a 'clean' copy you can go back to. 

### Standard folder structure

The single most important geodata management practice is to use a standardised 
folder structure that contains all parts of the QGIS project. 

The paths from a QGIS project to the geodata are by default relative. This means 
when the data and the project are in a fixed folder structure, you can move the 
whole structure without impacting the QGIS project or the paths to the data.
The version of a standardized folder structure that is used for all exercises 
in this training is explained below. A template of the folder structure can be 
downloaded [__here__](https://github.com/GIScience/gis-training-resource-center/blob/main/fig/GIS_Project_folder_template.zip).

 A standard folder structure has two principal advantages:

1. If we share the whole project folder, we can expect the project to run 
   without problems on a different computer
2. The folder structure supports the proper organisation of project data and 
   helps ensure the QGIS project will work as intended

<!-- CHECK: add source -->

### Geodata naming 

There are some basic principles when it comes to naming geodata that you produce 
or manipulate:
<!-- CLARIFY: why do we need naming principles? -->
<!-- CLARIFY: does this apply to file names, layer names, or both? -->

* Do not use special characters like `!`,`?`, `/` or `-`.
* Do not use blank spaces, use underscores `_`
* Give layers meaningful names so that you can understand what they represent, 
  even if they are a temporary/intermediate step in a workflow. 

Below you can see an example of a workflow to process an admin boundary dataset 
(`adm0`). The purpose of the intermediate steps is not clear because the layer 
names are not meaningful. 

`adm0 >> adm0_temp >> adm0_temp2 >> adm0_temp3 >> facilities_final`

A better system of naming is shown below. In this version, it is clear what 
processing was performed at each step (reproject, clip layer, join with another layer, 
output). <!-- CHECK: Is this understanding correct? --> 
In this way, other people can understand what purpose different layers serve and 
whether they are needed in the final project.  

`adm0 >> adm0_projUTM >> adm0_projUTM_clipUrban >> adm0_projUTM_clipUrban_intersectFacilities >> facilities_processed`


## Data import

Before you can start creating maps in QGIS, you need to add your data. 

Depending on which file format you want to import, the process differs slightly.

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Vector data import

Typical vector data formats are Shapefile (`.shp`) and GeoPackage (`.gpkg`). 
The process of importing vector data in either of the two formats is the same. 
[Section 2.1](../../content/Modul_2/en_qgis_geodata_concept.md) has a list of 
common vector data formats. <!-- CHECK: Is it possible to link to the section of 
  the page? -->

```{Note}
GeoPackage files can contain multiple datasets and even whole QGIS projects. 
When you load a GeoPackage in QGIS, a window will appear where you can select 
the datasets you want to load.
```

There are two ways to load vector data in QGIS. Via the `Layer` menu or via 
drag-and-drop.
<!-- FIXME: Also through the browser pane and keyboard shortcuts -->

### Open vector data via Layer menu

1. Click on `Layer`-> `Add Layer`-> `Add Vector Layer...`
2. Click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to your 
   vector file
3. Select the file and click `Open`
4. Back in QGIS click `Add`

<!-- CLARIFY: What should people do with optional settings? -->
<!-- ADD: Should mention zipped vs unzipped shapefiles -->

:::{tab-item} Delimited text import

### Open  Delimited Text Layer (.csv, .txt)

```{Tip}
To load data from spreadheets such as Comma Separated Value (`.csv`) or 
Excel (`.xlsx`), the datasets need to have columns containing geometry - this is 
most often in the form of latitude (Y field) and longitude (X field), but might 
also be in other formats. 
```

```{figure} /fig/en_import_delimeted_text.png
---
width: 600px
name: 
align: center
name: Import delimited text
---
Import delimited text.
```

1. `Layer` -> `Add Layer` -> `Open Delimited Text Layer`.
2. Click on `File name` click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and 
   navigate to your csv file and click `Open`.
3. `File Format`: Here you can specify which delimiter is used in the file you 
   want to import. In a standard .csv file commas `,` is used. If this is not the 
   case, select `Custom delimiters`. Here you can choose the exact delimiter 
   used in your file. 

```{Tip}
To find out which delimiter is used you can open your .csv file in Notepad or 
Excel. There you can check which delimiter is used to separate the information.
```

```{figure} /fig/en_delimited_text_fileformat.png
---
width: 600px
name: 
align: center
name: Import delimited text - file format
---

```

4. `Geometry definition`: In this section, you specify which columns of the file 
   contain the spatial information to georeference the data on the map. If the 
   file has a column containing __latitude__ and another with __longitude__ data, 
   you can use them to georeferenced the data. Check `Point Coordinates`. Select 
   for `X field` ‚ÄúLONGITUDE‚Äù and for `Y field` ‚ÄúLATITUDE‚Äù.
   <!-- CLARIFY: When wouldn't you choose Point ? -->
5. Under `Geometry CRS` select the coordinate reference system (CRS). By default, 
   QGIS will select the CRS of the project. 

   If the file does not have spatial information choose the option `No geometry 
   (attribute only table)`.
6. Click `Add`

:::{tab-item} Raster data import

There are two ways to load vector data in QGIS, via the `Raster` tab or via 
drag-and-drop.
<!-- FIXME: as above - also via browser panel and keyboard shortcut -->

### Open raster data via Layer menu

1. Click on `Layer`-> `Add Layer`-> `Add Raster Layer`
2. Click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to your 
   raster file
3. Select the file and click `Open`
4. Back in QGIS click `Add`

## Geo features and attributes

Each vector layer consists of geometric features (points, lines or polygons) and 
an __attribute table__. The attribute table contains information on each feature 
in the layer. The information is stored in rows and columns in the attribute table. 
Each __row__ in the table represents a __feature__, while __columns__ store 
__attributes__ of that feature. You can use the attribute table to search, sort, 
filter, edit and select data.

Having a look into the attribute table can be helpful to get an overview on the 
data you are working with. 
<!-- CLARIFY: What types of things can people get an overview of? -->

### Open the attribute table

One can open the attribute table in two ways. Either click right on the chosen 
layer and select `Open Attribute Table` or click on the attribute table symbol 
in the toolbar. 

```{figure} /fig/en_attributetable_right_click.png

```{note} 
If you have multiple layers, only the attribute table of the layer currently 
selected in the layer panel will open. 
```

### Sort the attribute table

Now that the attribute table is opened, it is possible to sort the data within. 
By clicking on the tab of the column, you can sort the data (alphabetically) in 
ascending or descending order. The small arrow indicates whether it is sorted 
ascending or descending.

### Manually select features in the attribute table

To interact with features in a layer you have to select these features. One way 
to select features is via the attribute table.

* __Select:__ Click on the lines of the features. 
* __Multi Select:__ To select multiple features press `Ctrl` and select `features`.
* __Show only selected features:__ In the bottom left of the attribute table open 
  the dropdown menu and select `Show selected features`. To show again all 
  features click on `Show all features`. 
* __Only show unselected features__ Select features and click on ![](/fig/mActionInvertSelection.png)

### Zoom to selected area
Now that you learned how to select features, you can zoom onto your area of 
interest. To do so you can click on the symbol on the top pannel or click right 
on the layer and select `Zoom to Selection`

```{figure} /fig/en_zoom_to_selection_1.png

```

### Save only selected features as a new file

After you selected your data, you might want to proceed with only the Selection. 
It is possible to save your Selection as new layer. To do so click right on the 
layer -`Export` -> `Save only selected features`

You can then choose the format, layername and crs.

```{tip}
Use GeoPackage (.gpkg) instead of Shapefile (.shp)!
If you are unsure which format is best, check out the wiki [Geodata types](../Wiki/en_qgis_geodata_types_wiki.md)

## Base maps

Basemaps are background maps. They are often very practical since they are easy 
to use, allow easy orientation on the map canvas and are diverse. QGIS offers 
OpenStreetMap and some other base maps by default. 

However, there is a wide range of base maps that can be used via extra plugins 
or XYZ Connections.

Here we give you an overview of ways to access base maps in QGIS.

### Standard QGIS Basemaps

You can always add the standard OpenStreetMap as a basemap to your map canvas. 

```{tip}
In the [wiki article on base maps](../Wiki/en_qgis_basemaps_wiki.md), you can find a tutorial to add more base maps e.g. from google to the standard base map list of your QGIS.
```
There are two ways to add the OpenStreetMap as a basemap.

__Option 1:__ Find in the `Browser` panel `XYZ Tiles`. Open the dropdown by 
clicking on it and select OpenStreetMap or another basemap.

__Option 2:__ `Layer` -> `Add Layer` -> `Add XYZ layer...` -> Select the 
OpenStreetMap or another basemap.


<video width="100%" controls src="https://github.com/GIScience/gis-training-resource-center/raw/main/fig/Add_basemap_OSM.mp4"></video>



### QuickMapServices

There are numerous extensions for QGIS, also called plugins, which provide 
extended functionalities. In the wiki article about plugins, you can learn all 
about them.
One of the most important plugins is the 
[QuickMapServices](https://nextgis.com/blog/quickmapservices/) plugin.

The QuickMapServices Plugin allows to access a wide range of basemaps. 

:::{dropdown} Installation of plugins
To install a plugin `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install Plugins‚Ä¶` -> `All` -> 
Search for the plugin -> `Install Plugin`

<video width="100%" controls src="https://github.com/GIScience/gis-training-resource-center/raw/main/fig/qgis_plugins.mp4"></video>

```{Tip}
If you cannot find a specific extension, check your capitalisation and correct 
use of spaces. If you still cannot find an extension, you may need to allow the 
experimental extensions in the options (see below).
```
