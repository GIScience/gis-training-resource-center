# Exercises for Module 2

__ðŸ”™[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__

These exercises are designed to support a QGIS-training and can be done with participants as follow-along exercises or as homework before the next training. 
- Exercise 1 and 2 cover the basics to familiarise beginners with geodata and how to import, inspect, and save vector data in QGIS. These exercises are suited for follow-along sessions. 
- Exercise 2 and 3 expand on the first two exercises and aim to teach GIS beginners to find, download, and import data from the web. 
- Exercise 5 recapitulates module 2 and can be used by trainees to refresh their QGIS-skills __on their own__ before the next session.


| Exercise| Description |Focus Group|Estimated time| 
| :-------------------- | :----------------- |:----------------- |:----------------- |
|__[Exercise 1: Understanding Geodata](/content/Modul_2/en_qgis_geodata_concept_ex1.md)__ | The objective of this exercise is to make your first steps in QGIS. Understand the user interface and get to know the layer concept. Display vector data in QGIS and view the attributes of the data. Reproject the vector data (i.e. by changing the projection of the data) | QGIS Essentials | 2 hours | 
|  __[Exercise 2: Basic Geodata Processing](/content/Modul_2/en_qgis_basic_data_processing_ex1.md)__ | The objective of this exercise is to get a feeling for geodata and start working with it. Understand the attribute table, sort it, select manually and export the selection. | QGIS Essentials | 1 hour | 
| __[Exercise 3: Data Sources](/content/Modul_2/en_qgis_data_sources_ex1.md)__ | The aim of this exercise is to navigate various data sources, gain an understanding of where and how to access relevant data, and identify potential problems. | QGIS Essentials | 1-2 hours |
| __[Exercise 4: Exporting OSM Data](/content/Modul_2/en_qgis_data_sources_ex2.md)__ | The aim of this exercise is to learn multiple ways to export OpenStreetMap (OSM) data as vector files and load them into QGIS. | Data acquirement and data management | 2 hours |
| __[Exercise 5: The World](/content/Modul_2/en_qgis_modul_2_ex_1.md)__ | The aim of this exercise is to create a QGIS project, import vector data, move layers in the layer hierarchy, and save the progress made to your QGIS-project. This exercise can be done alone at home. | QGIS Essentials | 1 hour |
