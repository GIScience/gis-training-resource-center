**Competences:**

In this chapter, you will learn what __geodata__ is, and understand the difference between __vector and raster 
data__. Furthermore, this chapter explains the __layer concept__ of GIS-software, which is fundamental to every map 
you will create. Finally, we will explain the basics of __projections__, which is the method of how we display the 
spherical shape of our planet onto a 2 dimensional plane. 

## What is geodata?

Geodata, geospatial data, or geographic data is data that has geographical information. This means that the data 
refers to a location, that is defined by coordinates. It is similar to other forms of data that can be represented 
in tables (such as Excel spreadsheets or CSV-files) but each item in the data set also holds coordinate information 
(see figure below).
GIS-software helps us visualise and manipulate geodata in a 2D (or even 3D) space. Geodata represents a real-world 
object on a map as a feature. A feature consists of two types of information: the geospatial location - the 
coordinates - and attributes - e. g. name, length, elevation, or any other information.

What type of information can be stored in geodata is almost endless. It can hold information about the physical 
world - such as elevation data, environmental data (soils, climate, temperature, rainfall, information about 
weather events or natural phenomena), data about the infrastructure, buildings, transportation, etc. - or 
sociocultural or economic data - such as demographic data, administrative boundaries, social events, crime, etc. 
Geodata usually represents data entries as __geometries__ on a 2D canvas. These geometries can be points, lines, 
rectangles, circles, or polygons and can represent various objects that exist in the physical world - such as 
roads, lakes, trees, etc. - or represent intangible objects - such as administrative boundaries, population 
numbers, health indicators, historical events, etc.

There are two primary types of geographic data: **vector data and raster data**. Both types represent tangible or 
intangible things in the real world. However, how they store this data is quite different. Because of this, the 
manipulation and representation of these two types differs dramatically. Understanding the difference between these 
two types, and how to work with each type on it's own, as well as, combining both types, will be one of the main 
skills you will acquire when learning GIS.

### Vector data

Vector data represents spatial information through geometrical shapes, such as points, lines, or polygons. Each 
object stores the location (as address or coordinates) and further attributes, e.g. name, ID, or any other sort of 
information. Which geometry is used, depends on the type of data that is represented. For example, a road will be 
represented by a line, a building will be represented by polygon and a tree might be represented by a point.

- Pointdata usually only have one set of coordinates (x, y, and sometimes z) per data entry.
- Lines are constructed by connecting multiple points which are saved as a single data entry.
- Polygons are also constructed by connecting several points, but they form a closed geometry. Each geometry is then represented by a single data entry.


<!-- Insert example of constructed geometries -->

#### Vector file formats

There are several file formats for vector data. They each differ in how the geometries and attributes are stored. However, they still all only contain points, lines, or polygons. Some formats have advantages over others, while others are still used out of convention, although they are outdated.
The following table gives a short description of commonly used vector file formats.

| Filename extension| Name | Description |
| ----- | --- | --- |
|.shp | Shapefile |Old but still widely used geodata format. Can only contain one dataset. The file has to consist of at least three different files (.shp, .shx, .dbf)|
|.gpkg| GeoPackage  | Very versatile geodata format and the new standard for geodata. Can contain multiple datafiles (vector, raster and non-spatial data like tables)|
|.kml |Keyhole Markup Language | Geodata format for use with [Google Earth]( https://earth.google.com/web/)|
| .gpx| GPS Exchange Format|Geodata format for the exchange of coordinates. For example for waypoints of tracks. |
| .geojson|GeoJSON| Open data format using Javascript Object Notation to store geographic data. Can store multiple type of geometries in one file. | 


### Raster data

Another type of geospatial data is raster data. Raster data consists of cells that are organized into a grid with 
rows and columns, thus forming a raster. Each cell, or pixel, contains a value which holds information (for 
example, temperature, or population density). Since raster data consists of pixels, aerial photographs or satellite 
imagery can also be used as raster data, if they have geographical coordinates (see [georeferencing]()).
<!-- FIXME: insert georeferencing link --> 

Typical raster data can be, for example, elevation data (or digital elevation model, DEM), precipitation data, 
interpolated temperature data, or population density. The value of each cell is usually visualised by assigning a 
color to a value. For elevation data, for example, a color ramp is usually used. For categorical data, such as 
landuse, color categories (such as green = forest; yellow = agricultural landuse, red = residential). 

<!--- ADD: insert example of raster data -->

Raster values usually have only 1 value per cell, however, it can also have multiple (color-)bands. Satellite 
imagery usually offers several bands (different light spectrum), which we can use to analyze different phenomena, 
such as the humidity of plants. Multiple bands means that you have more than one value per cell.

The main spatial characteristics are the extent - the area the grid represents in the real world (10km^2, 100km^2) - and the raster resolution - the size of each pixel. In the image below, you can see two raster datasets with different resolutions.

#### Raster data formats

Raster data can have the following data formats:

| Filename extension| Name | Dscription |
| ----- | --- | --- |
|.tif/.tiff/.geotiff|Tag Image File Format|Common raster and image data format. Does not necessarily have georeferenced data. If a .tif file is georeferenced it is referred to as GeoTIFF.|
|.nc|netCDF|Standard data format for scientific data like speed or temperature. Can be be a raster file. Can contain multiple datasets|
|.asc|Esri ASCII Grid files|Old, simple raster file format, always with georeferenced data|

## The layer concept

GIS-software helps us visualise geographic data. It does so by displaying the geometries or raster cells on a 2D 
canvas. However, when creating a map, we are using multiple datasets at once. Every type of geographic data, such 
as raster data, polygons, points, or lines, is usually stored inside a __layer__. Each layer consists of geographic 
objects of the same type (line, polygon, raster, ...). GIS-software displays these layers on top of each other and 
let's you rearrange the order of these layer, in order to create insightful maps. [^1]

By adding different layers, you build your map and can combine information from 
different sources. With those you then can perform analyses or adapt the 
representation by using symbols and colors.

## Projections 
### Introduction

An important issue when creating a map of a region, is that it is impossible to create a representation of a sphere 
on a 2D plane without distorting the map.
The way in which the globe is represented on a flat surface is called a __projection__. There are many different 
methods to achieve this.  These are called **coordinate reference systems (CRS)**. Every projection either distorts 
the __length__ between two points or from a single point (equidistant map projection), the __size__ of an area 
(equiareal map projection), or the __angles__ between two lines (conformal map projection). However, some 
projections are able to display the angles correctly, while others display the sizes of an area or the distance 
between two points correctly.

name: Examples for Projections (azimuthal, cylindrical and conic)
---

```

Every projection has it use case. For example, the Mercator projection displays the angles between to points 
correctly. This was used extensively during the seafaring age without satellites, as ships could navigate to a 
destination by following a straight line on a map. For example, the Mercator projection displays road intersections 
correctly: a road that crosses another road at a right angle, will be displayed as such on a mercator projection. 
This is especially useful when navigating. The shape of an area remains correct, since the angles between each line 
stays true. However, if you increase the scale of the map, the size and distances get distorted dramatically (see 
figure below). Furthermore, the further away from the equator you get, the more distortion you get. You can check 
the true size in comparison to different placements on the map on [TheTrueSize.com website](https://www.thetruesize.com). A 
popular example is Greenland in comparison with Africa, which seem on the map to be about the same size, but in 
reality Africa is a lot bigger.

### How to choose an appropriate projected coordinate system

In GIS, we project the earth onto a flat coordinate system (hence the name coordinate reference system or CRS). 
It is crucial that you are aware that you data can be in one CRS and your QGIS 
project in an other CRS. The data and the project should always be the same, or 
else you will get wrong results! The project CRS is displayed on the bottom left 
corner of the [QGIS interface](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Modul_1/en_qgis_start.html#overview-of-qgis-interface).  
To change the CRS of you data and project, follow the steps explained below.
The default CRS/EPSG code of every QGIS project is the World Geodetic System 84 
(EPSG: 4326). This CRS is optimized for world maps. So not perfect for most 
applications, because we mostly use maps for small areas. 

```{Tip}
Choose the projection according to your area of interest. There are special CRS, that have been created to reduce 
the distortion and inaccuracy of projections for different regions on earth. You can find all the projections and 
their CRS codes on [EPSG.io](http://epsg.io). 
```

This table shows an overview on which projections to use for which needed 
characteristic:

| Characteristic  | Mercator (cylindrical) | Lambert cylindrical | Albers conic |
| :----------- |:--------------------: | :-----------------: | :----------: |
| Shape | [x]             |  [ ]          |  [x]    |
| Rotation | [x]           |  [x]      |  [ ]  |
| Area | [ ]              |  [x]            |  [x]    |

<!-- I don't fully understand this?-->

For smaller areas local projections should be used, since they give a more 
accurate display at the expense of more distortion at the global level.

### How to check and change the project coordinate reference system

```{Note}
One of the first things you do when starting a new QGIS project should be to check and adjust the CRS/EPSG code to 
the region or area you are working on. If you are working on a map showing the entire globe, global projection such 
as the mercator projection should be used. If you are working on a smaller region, such as a continent, a country, 
or even smaller regions, __you should always use a local CRS, to avoid inaccuracies__. 
```

1. Open a QGIS project
2. In the very down right corner of QGIS you find the butten `EPSG`. The number 
next to it is the EPSG Code currently used in the project. To see more information, or to change the CRS, click on the `Current CRS`-button ![](/fig/EPSG_Code.png). 
3. The window `Project Properties` will open. Here you can view all availble 
CRS/EPSG-Code and their properties.
4. To change the CRS/EPSG code, select the one you want to use and click `Apply`.

### Project CRS and Layer CRS

The Coordinate reference system of your QGIS project determines how QGIS displays the information. However, layers 
and datasets have their own CRS. This can be seen in the metadata, or layer properties of the dataset. The layer 
CRS refers to the coordinate system of the features or items in the dataset. The same coordinates in two different 
coordinate reference system do not refer to the same location on earth. This is because of the distortion of 
distance and area.

```{note}
The first thing you should do when loading a new layer or dataset into your QGIS project, should be to check the 
coordinate reference system of the dataset, and reproject it to the project CRS if necessary. This way, you ensure 
consistency in your project and that the geoobjects in your layer are at the right locations. Otherwise, you will 
create false results.
```
