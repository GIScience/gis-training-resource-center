# QGIS Trigger Workflow for Somalia 

The QGIS workflow presented in this article was developed in the framework of the Forecast-based-Action (FbF) Project of the Somalia Red Cresent Society (SRCS), the German Red Cross (GRC) and the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT).

The workflow consists of 15 steps of which 9 are automated in the form of a QGIS Model. In this article, we explain how all 15 steps can be done manually. In practice one needs to do only 6 steps manually, the rest is done by the QGSI Model.
The chapter Workflow Automated explains the process and how it is intended in practice. The chapter Workflow Manually is to understand what happens inside of the QGIS Model.
