# AI Logistic Awareness System (AILAS) Street View image collection Field Experiments

This documentation aims to consolidate all information regarding the Street View image collection field experiments for AILAS. It focuses on the process of collecting Street View images and is intended for use by participants in the experiments as a practical guideline.

:::{admonition} Experiment Goal
:class: tip
One of the key components of AILAS is the ongoing collection of street view images in the field. This experiment aims to gather experience in collecting such images in Madagascar and to obtain feedback on the usability of the cameras and the web upload process. Additionally, a secondary objective is to capture street view images in Madagascar for future use in AILAS once it becomes operational.

### AILAS Vison

The AI Logistic Awareness System (AILAS) is a proposed system that enables users to view real-time road passability through a browser-based Geographic Information System (GIS). This will be accomplished by integrating current rainfall data and weather forecasts with information about the roads gathered from street view images.


### Goal of Field Experiments
