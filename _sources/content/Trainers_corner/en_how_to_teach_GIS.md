# How to teach GIS

This article will focus on best practices for teaching GIS. 

Learning GIS can be challenging, especially for individuals who are new to the topic or have limited experience with technology beyond standard office systems. The concept of geodata and everything that it entails is quite removed from the things many people work on day to day in the humanitarian sector. To grasp these concepts is however essential to work effectively with GIS and solve problems. That being said, often there is not enough time to dive deep into topics like projections or algorithms. And we lean more towards practical hands-on training.

That is why we must be aware of balancing practical hands-on and theory when teaching GIS. 
In the following, we will present best practices for teaching GIS according to our experiences. We will start with overarching topics. The further we progress, the further we will dive into practical things to do when teaching GIS.


## Theory vs. Hands-on

In general, we want to teach GIS in a way that people understand how they can do specific things in the easiest way possible. This means we focus on practical exercises with a real-world connection so it is easy for people to see how they can use GIS in their work. However, sometimes we need to teach things theoretically. Usually, because they are either so essential people have to understand the concept before doing anything in GIS e.g. the layer concept. Or, not knowing the concept results in errors and problems when working with GIS and geodata e.g. projections. 

Balancing theory and hands-on practice is essential in GIS training. Here, we outline best practices for incorporating both aspects effectively:

* Make the trainees understand why it is important to understand the concept. E.g. avoiding mistakes and wrong results or being able to work much faster. For example, if they work with geodata that is projected in different coordinate reference systems.
* Use graphics, videos and other mediums to explain the concept. For example, to teach the topic of projections in Modul 1 we use videos and graphics. You can even bring a paper model and [demonstrate](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/the-cartographers-dilemma/) the concept example.

```
* Make the connection from the theory to the practical use of GIS. For example, show in what kind of errors a wrong projection can result and why projections like UTM are important to use meters and kilometres when for example buffering.

## GIS for tackling real-world problems

In the fast-paced world of humanitarian aid, time is a precious commodity, and the need to assist those in need directly is paramount. The motivation of trainees is highly dependent on them seeing the value GIS can bring to their daily work. That is why we always should work with real-life examples, data and exercises.  Abstract exercises are not as effective as real-world ones. 

This topic is reflected on the whole platform. The principal section dealing with the topic is [Modul 1: Examples of GIS used by humanitarian organisations](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Modul_1/en_qgis_theorie.html#examples-of-gis-used-by-humanitarian-organisations).

On this training platform, nearly all exercises are oriented on products that are standard in the humanitarian sector like overview maps or maps of affected regions. 

Practical tips to make exercise and teaching relevant for humanitarian work:
* Reflect on your audience and think about what kind of products they would need the most.
* In the beginning, go with easy map products for reports and presentations. In our experience that is interesting for everybody since everybody needs to present and report their work in reports or proposals.
* Customize exercises to simulate scenarios commonly encountered in humanitarian work, such as creating situational maps for emergency response teams or analyzing spatial data to identify high-risk areas.
* Encourage trainees to explore real datasets and develop GIS solutions for actual humanitarian challenges, fostering hands-on learning and problem-solving skills.
* Utilize case studies or success stories from organizations like Relifeweb to illustrate the tangible impact of GIS in humanitarian operations, inspiring trainees and reinforcing the value of their training.
* Present instances where GIS has been instrumental in fulfilling a mission.
* Empower trainees by involving them in the curriculum planning process, allowing them to identify the types of maps and products most relevant to their work.
