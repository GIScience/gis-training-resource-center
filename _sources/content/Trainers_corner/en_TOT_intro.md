# Train of trainers introduction

__üîô[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__

Welcome to the trainer's corner! Here you can find all the information about how to plan your training and how to teach GIS.
This short article will give an overview of the training platform and outline the function of all artikel in the trainer's corner.

```{admonition} Contact the IFRC GIS Training Plattform Team
You have questions, feedback or comments on the platform and the content. We are allways happy to hear from you. You can contact us via email   __gis-training-plattform@heigit.org__

## What this platform can do for you and what not

This platform is intended to make your life as a trainer easier by providing you with three things. Explanatory articles called __modules__, __exercises__ and the __Wiki__. These components are explained in detail below.
What the platform can not do is take over all preparatory work. You still need to plan your training and you need to prepare any presentation you want to use. 

* üéì The __modules__ are intended to serve as references for trainees who want to delve deeper into a topic or review concepts. Think of the modules as an enhanced version of PowerPoint slides you would nomaly hand over to your trainees, providing comprehensive information for trainees. They can also serve as a guide for trainers to assess what trainees should learn at different stages of their GIS education.

* ‚úçÔ∏è The __exercises__ encompass all the content covered in the modules. They range from smaller exercises focused on specific topics like the QGIS interface to larger-scale exercises covering entire modules. These exercises can be utilized in any order or format, including [follow-along exercisesor group work](handson). Additionally, trainers can assign exercises as homework for trainees who are capable of completing them independently.

* üìñ The __Wiki__ serves as a support resource for both trainees and trainers during QGIS usage, whether during exercises or in day-to-day work. It provides trainers with the assurance that their trainees have access to an updated, interactive resource to help solve challenges encountered while using QGIS.

After this small overview, we can conclude what the platform can and can not do for you:
