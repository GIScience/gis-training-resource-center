# Train of trainers introduction 

Welcome to the trainer's corner! Here you can find all the information about how to plan your training and how to teach GIS.
This short article will outline the function of all artikel in the trainer's corner and give an overview of the training platform.



## What this platform can do for you and what not

This platform is intended to make your life as a trainer easier by providing you with three things. Explanatory articles called __modules__, __exercises__ and the __Wiki__. These components are explained in detail below.
What the platform can not do is take over all preparatory work. You still need to plan your training and you need to prepare any presentation you want to use. 

* üéì The __modules__ are intended to serve as references trainees can consult if they want to dive deeper into a topic or to reiterate things. Imagen the modules as a better version of PowerPoint slides you would normally provide the trainees with. 
The modules can also be an indicator for you as a trainer for what trainees should learn at a stage in their GIS education. 

* ‚úçÔ∏è The __exercises__ cover all the content of the modules. There are smaller exercises specific to certain topics like the QGIS interface and large-scale exercises covering whole modules. These exercises can be used in any order or way you like. You can use them for follow-along exercises or group work.
You can also use the exercises as homework for trainees if they are on the skill level to handle them on their own. 

* üìñ The __Wiki__ is intended to support trainees and you while using QGIS both during exercises but also in your day-to-day work. The Wiki gives you as a trainer the confidence that your trainees have an updated interactive resource they can use to solve 85 % of their challenges when using QGIS.

After this small overview, we can conclude what the platform can and can not do for you:
