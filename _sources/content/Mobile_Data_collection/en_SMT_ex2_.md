# Sketch Map Tool Exercise 2 - Traffic light

🚧This training platform and the entire content is under ⚠️construction⚠️ and may not be shared or published! 🚧

This exercise focuses on exploring the basemaps and discussing challenges of map literacy and orientation on the maps, as well as the characteristics, strengths, currency (possibility to update) and differences basemaps based on Satellite images or OSM.

## Characteristics of the exercise 
#### Aim of this exercise:
- Get familiar with the OSM and Satellite-image base maps and the Quality reports.
- Get a feeling how to assess the usability of a basemaps and possible problems.


#### Phase of participatory /community mapping 
preparing participatory mapping
#### Focus group (GIS-Knowlege Level)
planners/ facilitatiors  (Beginners-level: no knowledge required about QGIS)
#### Type of trainings exercise:
This exercise can be used in online and presence training and is focused on group discussions.
#### Estimated time demand for the exercise.
In general: about 1:15 h to 1:35 h (depending on number of groups)

```

| Introduction| Groupe exercise | Wrap-up (with presentations)|
| :-------------------- | :----------------- | :---------- |
| 10 min | 35 min - 10 min for creating the maps  - 25 min group discussion | Online mapping platform| - each group about 5 min to present  - 10 min general discussion - a bit buffer time for the change of the groups
```


## Instructions for the trainers 

:::{dropdown} Trainers Corner
### Preparation and material 
- Online access and devices (PC) to be able to use the Sketch Map Tool and create maps online.
- Alternative print or share for each group one individual set of the Sketch Maps (OSM + satellite) and reports of one area OSM + satellite -map and the fitting report.
- Take a look and make yourself familiar on the provided material for the exercise and the Sketch Map Tool in general. 
- Prepare a board (it can be a white board /flipchart / or digital e.g. mirro-board) where the participants can add their findings.

### Available Material: needs to be linked directly 
- Introduction Slides with tips and a short basic introduction in the differences of satellite image /OSM
- 5 prepared cases (with Sketch Maps and Map Quality Check) Link to Data


### During the exercise:  
#### Introduction: 
- Make sure everyone is familiar with the basic understanding about OSM and satellite maps. Introduce the aim of the exercise and the idea of the traffic lights and the analysis before you start the exercise!
- Provide access the needed material and build groups (in groups at least 3 people each to discuss together) best Groups of 3-6 participants)

#### Time for group work: 
- Check-in with the groups if there are questions or problems.
- Prepare the presentation tool for the Wrap-Up.


#### Wrap up: 
- All groups present their findings (each 5 min, make it short but show the maps they are talking about).
- Discuss Benefits as well as challenges and problems in the use of the sketch Map Tool 
- Time to for Open questions.

## What you need to know - background information

### Benefits of the Sketch Map

#### During the data collection: 
- Maps provide orientation and can guide discussions
- With the sketching you achieve an immediate visualization of local knowledge.

#### After the data collection:
- Displaying and sharing the result 

### Characteristics of the two base maps 

| | satelite imagery| OSM data|
| :-------------------- |:-------------------- | :----------------- | 
| data source | World Imagery ESRI (-> Link: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=10df2279f9684e4a9f6a7f08febac2a9#!) | OSM Community  | 
| example map | ```{figure} /fig/SMT_Satelite_Heidelberg_empty.jpg``` | ```{figure} /fig/SMT_Heidelberg_empty.jpg``` | 
| curentness | The satelite imagery is typically within 3-5 years of currency. | Current OSM-data is used in the base map. | 
| biggest benefit | Impression of the landscape and topography | clear outlines and at times labels especilay of important infrastructure e.g. hospitals, possibilty to improve the map by contributing to OSM.| 

### What does georefferenced means?

| A not georeferenced image | A georeferenced image – GeoTIFF |
| :-------------------- | :----------------- | 
| Just an image, even if you load it in QGis and give it a coordination system it can´t be located and the image is shown somewhere in the Atlantic. | The file contains information about its coordinate system and its location, so you can combine it other geodata e.g. with GPS data.|

### Map Quality Check

```
The Sketch Map Tool can evaluate how well-suited an area of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) basemap is for participatory mapping based on a quality analysis of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) basemap data through the HeiGIT ohsome quality analyst.  (→ Hyperlinks are missing to OSM and ohsome quality analyst).
The Map Quality Check assists in evaluating the suitability of the area of interest for participatory mapping through a quality analysis of the OpenStreetMap data with the HeiGIT ohsome quality analyst. The fitness report can be downloaded as a PDF file by clicking on the blue button. It provides an evaluation of the suitability of the local OSM data and recommendations for subsequent field data collection.

If you expieriences any problems during your use of the [Sketch Map Tool](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) please take a look at the [Help page](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/help).


### 1.	Create the maps and reports

- Open the Sketch Map Tool 
- Decide in your groupe on an area fitting to your case study. You kann also choose an area you know very well or find interesting.
- Zoom in and select your map area: Try different zoom levels and change the orientation. 
- Create several maps of the same area with different oration, zoom level and basemaps.

```{Tip}
To shorten the time you can work with prepared maps. Link data
```

### 2.	Collect your insights to the following questions
Add your insights to a presentation or on a (digital) board to share it later.
Discuss with your group: 
- What are the main characterise of the area you see on the basemap? Describe separately both basemaps the one with the satellite image and the OSM data. 
- Could you orient yourself on the basemap?  Are there points of interests / something you could use as a orientation point?
- Would you say the basemaps are suited for participatory mapping? Reason your answer and think about participants that are not familiar with basemaps.  
- Which difference can you detect between satellite and OSM basemaps?
- In which uses cases would you prefer the OSM basemap? 
- In which uses cases would you prefer the Satellite basemap?
- What traffic light colour would you give the satellite and OSM basemap individually for this area?
- Discuss the OSM-Mapping-suitability-report:
- What is the overall result of the basemap? (Which colour of the traffic light?)
- What are your most important findings from the OSM-Mapping-suitability-report?
- Would it make sense to organise a maperton beforehand to improve the OSM data?



### 3.	Wrap-up: 

Make some notes and prepare yourself for a short presentation (with your maps) in the big group to wrap the exercise together
- Prepare your Presentation and decide who is going to present it.
- Think about Open Questions, as well as feedback to the exercise
