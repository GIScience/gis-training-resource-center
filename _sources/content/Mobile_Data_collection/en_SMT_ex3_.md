# Sketch Map Tool Exercise 3 - Role Play using the Sketch Map Tool in EVCA

🚧This training platform and the entire content is under ⚠️construction⚠️ and may not be shared or published! 🚧


## Characteristics of the exercise 
#### Aim of this exercise:
Learn how you can visualize your Sketch Map Tool Outputs in either [QGIS](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Wiki/en_qgis_installation_wiki.html#qgis-installation) or [uMAP](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/).

#### Phase of participatory /community mapping 
analysing participatory mapping
#### Focus group (GIS-Knowlege Level)

- Exercise builds on prior-knowledge of Sketch Map Tool. Make sure [Execise 1](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Mobile_Data_collection/en_SMT_ex1_.html#sketch-map-tool-exercise-1-workflow-exercise) has been done before or knowlege on the background on Sketch Map Tool is there.

- GIS Beginners-level: no specific knowledge required

#### Type of trainings exercise:
This exercise can be used in  a presence training and is focused on an hands-on experience with the Sketch Map Tool as well as carrying out a participatory mapping activity
#### Estimated time demand for the exercise.



## Instructions for the trainers 

:::{dropdown} Trainers Corner
### Preparation

- Take a look and make yourself familiar on the provided material for the exercise and the Sketch Map Tool in general. 

### Available Material
* Introduction Slides about the Sketch Map Tool LINK
* Just the created map for (pre-printing)


### During the exercise:  
#### Introduction: 
- Introduce the idea, the aim and the general workflow of the Skech Map Tool beforehand.If you are focusing on EVCA you might use the [EVCA Skecth Map Tool Slides]() 
- Provide access to the needed material 
- check-in if there are questions or problems.

#### Wrap up: 
- Take some time at the end to wrap up and that several people present their result map
- Summarize challenges of participatory mapping approach
- Discuss Benefits of showing results as a map
- Time to for Open questions.

## Exercise: Roleplay

### Background

3 different cases
To do: what shouzld be mapped in this axercise? Report risks? Report challenges? Map vulnerabilities?

--> wir sdollten vielleicht auf eine der EVCA maps abzielen zB Capacity und Vulnerability Map oder Exoosure and Hazard map

### Prepare the roleplay and start discussion

Seperate into groups. For each case study there should be two groups: One group represents the community members and on group represents the facilitators. If your total group is too big, you can use case studies twice. Read the case study carefully.


__Facilitators__

The group of facilitators will seperate from the rest in order to prepare their activity.

- How do I best explain to the community why we do this activity and what is its added value, especially for them. How do I make them feel comfortable to share their information (concerning data protections, ethics)

- What do we want to find our when talking to the community? What do we want/ nedd to map?
- What questions would we have to raise in order to get the right answers
- How can I help community members to orientate on the map?
What shouzld be ampped, how should be mapped


__Community__

The community groups could prepare by distributing roles: old person, students, teacher, ... 
Beyong that,give your roles some chacateristics: e.g. very suspious person, questions alot if community should be part of this activity and if there is an added value; fearful character, wants to participate but is afraid of sharing information and its consecuences, old person that has lots of knowledge but cannot orientate in the map, very motivated person that wants to map more that it is asked for etc.



### Participatory Mapping Simulation

- facilitators: present the project and the actitivy that is planned to be carried out
- presentation of people present
- show the map and help to orientate
- community can ask questions
- together try to map


### Upload your created maps


Take a foto of your Sketches or at least one sketch and load them into [sketch-map-tool.heigit.org](https://sketch-map-tool.heigit.org/) and choose 'Digitize your Sketch maps' on the right. Upload all your sketches in .png or .jpg format. You can mark your sketches and simply drag and drop them into the window. 

Lets have a look on the results in order to understand the process.

__Load your data__ 

1. Open the Browser of your choice and navigate to the [UMAP Website](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) and click on the large green button `Create a Map`.
2. You can load your data into the map frame by clicking on the arrow button. The `Import data` window will open on the right hand side. CLick on `Select file` and navigate to your vector output from the Sketch Map Tool and click on `Open`. UMAP will automatically detect that your vector is a geojson format. Click on `Import` to load your data to your map canvas.
3. The detetced markings of your sketch map should now appear in the map canvas, you can zoom in and zoom out.

- Compare detected markings with your physical map. Did the tool detect your markings? 
- which markings got detecetd bettet than others? Can I learn a lesson about how i should better mark in the furture?




### Final discussion and conclusion


- Discuss the challenges ayou encountered and potentials you recognized of conducting a participatory mapping activity. What were the learnings?
- Discuss what you would do different when mapping with the SKetch Map Tool (e.g. use only one colour, etc.)
- Discuss the importance of a well planned activity in order to have usable outcomes
