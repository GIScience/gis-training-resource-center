# Glossary
 

| Term| Description | 
| -------- | --- | 
|Analysis Map | Analyses data in respect to their geographic location.|
| Atlas| An Atlas will generate a new page with the same map layout for each feature in a layer. For most purposes, it useful to first create a map layout with the elements such as legend, sources and overview map and then insert the map item that will be controlled by the Atlas. |
|Attribute Table | The attribute table displays information on features of a selected layer in QGIS. Each row in the table represents a feature (with or without geometry), while columns store specific attributes. This sort of table facilitates searching, selection, sorting, filtering, and editing of features.|
|Basemap | Background Map, (f. ex. Google or Bing Basemaps) < QuickMapServices.|
|Buffer Tool| Buffers define areas at specified distances from an object or set of objects in an environment. In GIS, buffers are ideal for analyses that involve distance constraints.
|Categorized Classification | Categorized Classification in QGIS groups spatial data into distinct categories based on specific attributes. This classification enhances the organization and interpretation of geospatial information for clearer insights.| 
|Cartography | Cartography is the study and practice of making maps.|
 Centroids |This process creates a new point layer, with points representing the centroids of the geometries of the input layer.
|Clip Tool |The  Clip tool is used to cut a vector layer with the boundaries of another polygon layer. It keeps only the parts of the features in the input layer that are inside the polygons of the overlay layer, creating a refined dataset.|
|Descriptive Map | A Descriptive Map is used to better visualize a specific ongoing and/or past situation.|
|Digitization | Digitization is the process of converting geographic data from maps or images into digital form commonly represented as vector data. During this procedure, spatial information from maps or images is traced, forming points, polylines, or polygons.|
|Dissolve Tool| The Dissolve Tool aggregates geometries with the same attribute values.|
|Field Calculator |The field calculator allows you that create a new field or update an existing one. You can perform calculations whether with existing attribute values or by using defined functions.|
|General Reference Map | A General Reference Map shows important physical features of an area.| 
|GIS| A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. GIS connects data to a map, integrating location data with all types of descriptive information.| 
|Graduated Classification |Graduated classification in GIS involves categorizing spatial data into classes or ranges based on a progression of values. This method is particularly useful for visualizing quantitative data, allowing for the differentiation of intensity, density, or magnitude across a spectrum, facilitating a nuanced representation of geographic phenomena.|
|Infrastructure Map |An Infrastructure Map displays relevant features and structures in a specific area.|
| Graduated Classification | A Graduated Classification in GIS involves categorizing spatial data into classes or ranges based on a progression of values. Graduated classification is used for quantitative data usually interval or ratio scaled.|
|Intersection | The Intersection Tool extracts the part of layers which overlap.|
|Layer |QGIS visualizes data by stacking layers on top of one another to create maps. Every layer represents one set of information. The layers are visible in the order in which they were arranged in a project.  A layer can only consist of geographic objects of the same type.| 
|Non-spatial Geodataprocessing| Non-spatial geodataprocessing in QGIS refers to the manipulation, subsetting and analysis of attribute data within a GIS environment without directly involving spatial components. It involves operations on the non-geometric attributes of geospatial datasets. This can include data cleaning, transformation, enrichment and analysis based on the associated attribute information, such as population statistics, land use classifications or economic indicators.|
|Non-spatial Queries| In GIS you can query (filter) data based on specific attribute information. Once the filtering is successful, only the desired features that correspond to the chosen attribute are displayed. Data filtering is a valuable technique for creating subsets of features that can be exported as a new layer.|
|Overview map| An overview map in the corner of your map will help locate the area you are viewing on the main map.|
|Plugins | Plugins are extensions for QGIS, which provide extended functionalities. |
|Print Layout| The print layout in QGIS is where you design and finalize the map in order to print or export it as a PDF or format of your choice. Here you can add important elements such as the legend, a title, an explanatory text and everything you need to create a comprehensive map. 
|Project File |All used geodata, styling files and documentation are stored in the Project File.| 
|Projections | Coordinate Reference Systems are in QGIS the default projection, or CRS, the WGS84 Geographic Coordinate System.|
|QGIS | QGIS is an open source geoinformation system software.|
|QuickOSM Plugin | By installing the QuickOSM plugin you can run the query directly in QGIS to download data from OpenStreetMap.
|Raster Data File | Raster Data are images which contain a matrix of pixels. Each pixel stores a value. Since a raster is based on an image, the resolution defines the accuracy of the data and size of the pixels.|
|Raster Data File Formats:|Raster data can have the following data formats.|
|.tif/.tiff/.geotiff |Tag Image File Format |
|.nc |netCDF |
|.asc |Esri ASCII Grid files |
|Single Symbol Classification |By default, QGIS visualizes all layers in the Single Symbol Setting. In this setting, many parameters like colour or opacity could be changed but data couldn't be classified.|
|Spatial Analysis | Spatial Analysis studies entities and events using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties.| 
Spatial Joins | Spatial joins in QGIS enhance the attributes of the input layer by adding additional information from the join layer, relying on their spatial relationship. This process enriches data by incorporating relevant details from one layer into another based on their geographical associations.|
|Spatial Queries |Spatial queries are all methods you use to select features based on their location. |
|Symbology for Raster Data |Raster data are basically a grid of pixels with different (numerical) values, so it is only possible to assign colours to the different values of the pixels.|
|Symbology for Vector Data | Graphical variables can be used to style vector data. Vector data can be either points, lines, or polygons. There are different options to symbolize these different types of vector data. 
|Text Data:| Text data can have the following data formats.
|.csv|comma-separated values|
|.xls|EXCEL|
|Thematic Map | A Thematic Map focusses on a specific theme or subject.|
|Topographic Map| A Topographic Map represents the physical location of objects in the real world. The representation of elements in topographic maps is done via conventional signs (e.g.: blue for water, green for forests, yellow for agricultural land).|
|Vector Data File | Vector Data is used to represent real world features in a GIS. A vector feature can have a geometry type of point, line or a polygon.|
|Vector File Formats:|Vector data can have the following data formats. 
|.shp |Shapefile|
|.gpkg | GeoPackage|
|.kml| Keyhole Markup Language < Google Earth | 
|.gpx |GPS Exchange Format |
|.geojson| GeoJSON|
