# Digitization Exercise 2

## Aim of the exercise:

In this exercise, you will learn how to digitise point, line, and polygon layer of a position or feature in a settlements by creating new datasets. Additionally, you will learn how to name the simple layers created.

## Task 1
There has been a controversial Nigerian Naira Notes Redesign Policy in Nigeria. The government began this policy on the 26th of October, 2022. This policy has caused many problems for the people of Nigeria not only in the business or health sector but in all works of life. See the article about how businesses groan as cash crunch hits Banks in Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria. [No cash article in Abuja](https://businessday.ng/news/article/business-groan-as-cash-crunch-hits-banks-in-abuja/).

Our goal is to create a point layers at the three Banks closed to each other in the Central Business District (CBD) of Abuja in Nigeria.This is to let people easily identify the banks in the CBD of Abuja for their transaction purposes. To this end, we will visualize the digitisation of the First Bank, Bank of Industrie Building and Zenith Bank Abuja. 

1. Open QGIS, on the browser layer move to XYZ Tiles and doulble click on OpenStreetMap. It will automatically loaded into the display layer of QGIS.
2. Search Abuja via the OSM Place Search in QGIS and choose Abuja Municipality Area council, City. Zoom to the Central Business District and create a point on each of the three banks in the CBD of Abuja.

## Task 2
A business man named Mr John who droves all the way from the North of Herbert Macauley Way in the CBD of Abuja to do transaction at the Bank of Indusrie on Monday morning. Unfortunately, he found out that the networt server of the bank is down and needed to proceed to the Zenith Bank as the only functioning Bank. He later discovered that there is an heavy road blocked at the junction of Indepence avenue and Tafawa Balewa way due to road construction.

##Please## create a road line layer for Mr John that will allow him to get to Zenith Bank easily.

## Task 3

Create a polygon layer covering the entire area of the Nigerian nationational Petroleum Cooperation Towers of the CBD of Abuja
