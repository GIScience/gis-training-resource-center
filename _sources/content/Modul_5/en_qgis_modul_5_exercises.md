__üîô[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__

These exercises touch on all the content of module 5.

## Spatial Geodataprocessing

* __[Healthsite distribution in Saint Louis region](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_spatial_tools_ex1.md):__ Become familiar with different types of spatial analysis and geoprocessing tools. Understand the process of discovering relationships and connections between features in spatial data.
    * Select by location
    * Select using an expression
    * Buffer
    * Geodata Classification - Graduated
    * Geodata Classification - Categorised

* __[Calculate vulnerability index - Part 1](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_spatial_tools_ex2.md):__ We want to create an overview of different vulnerability indicators. From the Covid-19 risk indicators dataset we take `% permanent wall type`, `% permanent roof type` and `poverty incidence`. From the Uganda population statistics, we calculate the `% of under fives` and `% of elderly`. By combining the data, we are now able to visualize the areas in Uganda that are most vulnerable.
    * Centroids
    * Move points
    * Reproject layer 
    * Fix geometries
    * Join attributes by location

## Non-Spatial Geodataprocessing

* __[Disaster effects in different regions of Senegal](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_non_spatial_tools_ex1.md):__ Become familiar with different types of non-spatial analysis and geoprocessing tools. Understand the process of discovering relationships and connections between features in spatial data.
    * Join Attribute by Field Value
    * Table functions
    * Field Calculator
    * Rename Field
    * Geodata Classification - Categorised

* __[Calculate vulnerability index - Part 2](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_non_spatial_tools_ex2.md):__ We want to create an overview of different vulnerability indicators. From the Covid-19 risk indicators dataset we take % permanent wall type, % permanent roof type and poverty incidence. From the Uganda population statistics we calculate the % of under fives and % of elderly. We combine the data and we are now able to visualize the areas in Uganda that are most vulnerable.
    * Join attributes by field value
    * Table functions
    * Field Calculator
    * Geodata Classification- Graduated


## BIG exercises module 5

These exercises touch on all the content of module 5. 

* __[Trigger & Intervention Map for Forecast-based-Action](/content/Modul_5/en_qgis_modul_5_ex2.md):__ This exercise is based on the monitoring and triggering process used by the Somalia Red Cresent Society (SRCS) in the framework of a drought Early Action Protocol (EAP).
Within this exercise, you will build a simplified version of the monitoring and trigger mechanism for the FEWSNET projection pillar.
