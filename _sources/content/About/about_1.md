# About

Whether being a beginner or already having some experiences, working with QGIS can be difficult.  
Our goal is to provide a comprehensive platform containing the essential skills and resources for the use in humanitarian aid without having to google for hours. üîé
In addition to the modules, we offer exercises and a wiki to enable individuals to work through the material and learn independently.  
This QGIS training is made by people who believe GIS can help humanitarians to serve people in need better. ‚ù§Ô∏è

### Our Mission:
We share the commitment to humanitarian aid. Through this website, our goal is to offer a unified, accessible and comprehensive resource, equipping individuals and organizations with the knowledge and tools necessary for working with QGIS. 
This Resource Center is also the resource for guided training modules.

## About Us:

The idea for this training platform originated from a group of people from the German Red Cross, British Red Cross and Netherlands Red Cross. üí°üì£ 

A group of dedicated student assistants and employees of the Heidelberg Institute for Geoinformation Technology (HeiGIT) are working to put together the materials on this platform. üî®
