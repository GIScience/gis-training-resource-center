## Instructions for the trainers

:::{dropdown} __Trainers Corner__ 

### Prepare the training

- Take the time to familiarise yourself with the exercise and the provided material.
- Prepare a white-board. It can be either a physical whiteboard, a flip-chart, or a digital whiteboard (e.g. Miro board) where the participants can add their findings and questions. 
- Before starting the exercise, make sure everybody has installed QGIS and has downloaded __and unzipped__ the data folder.
- Check out [How to do trainings?](https://giscience.github.io/gis-training-resource-center/content/Trainers_corner/en_how_to_training.html#how-to-do-trainings) for some general tips on training conduction

### Conduct the training

__Introduction:__

- Introduce the idea and aim of the exercise.
- Provide the download link and make sure everybody has unzipped the folder before beginning the tasks.

__Follow-along:__

- Show and explain each step yourself at least twice and slow enough so everybody can see what you are doing, and follow along in their own QGIS-project. 
- Make sure that everybody is following along and doing the steps themselves by periodically asking if anybody needs help or if everybody is still following.  
- Be open and patient to every question or problem that might come up. Your participants are essentially multitasking by paying attention to your instructions and orienting themselves in their own QGIS-project.

__Wrap up:__

- Leave time for any issues or questions concerning the tasks at the end of the exercise.
- Leave some time for open questions.

## Available Data

Download the data folder [here](https://nexus.heigit.org/repository/gis-training-resource-center/Module_2/Exercise_4/Module_2_Exercise_4_The_World.zip) and save it on your PC. Unzip the .zip file!
The folder is called ‚ÄúModule_2_Exercise_4_The_World" and contains the whole [standard folder structure](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_projects_folder_structure_wiki.md#standard-folder-structure) with all data in the input folder and the additional documentation in the documentation folder.

## Tasks

1. Open QGIS and create a [new project](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_projects_folder_structure_wiki.md#step-by-step-setting-up-a-new-qgis-project-from-scratch) by clicking on `Project` -> `New`
2. Once the project is created save the project in the ‚Äúproject‚Äù folder of the ‚ÄúEx_The_world‚Äù.  To do that click on `Project` -> `Save as` and navigate to the folder. Name the project ‚ÄúEx_The_World‚Äù.
3. Load the shape file "World_countries__generalized" in your project by drag and drop ([Wiki Video](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.md#open-vector-data-via-drag-and-drop)). Or click on `Layer`-> `Add Layer`-> `Add Vector Layer`. Click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to "World_countries__generalized". Select the file and click `Open`. Back in QGIS click `Add` ([Wiki Video](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.md#open-vector-data-via-layer-tab)).
``` {Attention}
With both methods, you need to select the file with the ending `.shp` ! 
```
4. Load the GeoPackage file "global_power_plant_database_nuclear.gpkg" in the QGIS project. You can use one of the methods above. Either drag and drop ([Wiki Video](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.md#open-vector-data-via-drag-and-drop)) the file or click on `Layer`-> `Add Layer`-> `Add Vector Layer`. Click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to "global_power_plant_database_nuclear.gpkg". Select the file and click `Open`. Back in QGIS click `Add`([Wiki Video](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.md#open-vector-data-via-layer-tab)).
```{Note}
GeoPackage file can contain multiple files and even whole QGIS projects. When you load such a file in QGIS a window will appear in which you have to select the files you want to load in your QGIS project.
```
5. Now we want to load the file ‚ÄúSignificant_earthquake_data.txt‚Äù into QGIS. Since this is vector data in text format we need to follow a certain process ([Wiki Video](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_import_geodata_wiki.md#open-csv-data-in-qgis)).
    * Click on `Layer`-> `Add Layer`-> `Add Delimited text Layer`. Click on the three points ![](/fig/Three_points.png) and navigate to "Significant_earthquake_data.txt". Select the file and click `Open`.
    * In the window "Data Source manager| Delimited Text" in QGIS open the dropdown menu `File Format` and check `Custom delimiter` and `Tab`
    * Open the dropdown menu `Geometry definition`. Make sure the option `Point coordinates` is checked. Furthermore, select for `X field` ‚ÄúLONGITUDE‚Äù and for `Y field` ‚ÄúLATITUDE‚Äù.
    * Select the coordinate reference system (CRS) "EPSG:4326-WGS 84".
    * Click `Add`
    ```{Note}
    When loading vector data in text format like .csv or .txt in QGIS, these data has to have latitude and longitude columns. 
    * `X field` =‚ÄúLONGITUDE‚Äù 
    * `Y field` = ‚ÄúLATITUDE‚Äù.
    ```

6. Arrange the three layers in a practical order. Remember the  [Layer Concept](/content/Wiki/en_qgis_layer_concept_wiki.md).
7. Interact with the map and explore the data sets. Use the zoom tool and move the map.
8. Save your project by clicking on the ![](/fig/mActionFileSave.png) or use the hotkey combination `Ctrl` + `S`
```{Tip}
If you see `*` before the name of your project on the top left corner of QGIS this means there are unsaved changes in your project. Save your progress!
```
9. Your results should look something like this:
