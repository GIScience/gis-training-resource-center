* Feature selection
* Basemap selection


## Data import

Before you can start visualizing and analysing in QGIS, you need to import your data. [Here](../../content/Modul_2/en_data_sources.md) you can look up, where to find different data sources.
Depending on which file format you want to import, the process differs slightly.

### Vector data import
The possible data formats are listed [here](../../content/Modul_2/en_qgis_geodata_concept.md). **add link to heading**  
Go to the data source manager and choose vector on the right. By clicking on the three dots you can browse your files and choose the ones you want to import.
