# Getting started with QGIS

## Intro QGIS concept

### Introducing QGIS

- QGIS is a __desktop software__: that means you get a program that opens up on your computer as a window with buttons you can click, forms you can fill out to do tasks, and it's generally a visual interactive experience. 

- QGIS is __open source__: That means the source code is available for everyone, making QGIS a free application. 

- QGIS is backed by a __large community of users__, so it’s easy to find solutions to technical issues by using QGIS forums, blog and subreddit.

```{Tip}
Exercise 3: Add basemaps
```
- In the browser pane scroll to __XYZ Tiles__
- Click on __OpenStreetMap__ and drag it to the layers pane
- Now in the browser pane right-click on XYZ Tiles and select __“New Connection”__
- In __Name__ type “Google Satellite”
- In __url__ copy and paste the following: [http://www.google.cn/maps/vt?lyrs=s@189&gl=cn&x={x}&y={y}&z={z}](http://www.google.cn/maps/vt?lyrs=s@189&gl=cn&x={x}&y={y}&z={z})
- Click __Ok__ then drag the newly created layer from XYZ Tiles to the layers pane
- Repeat for __Google Terrain__, you will find the url at [this link](https://socalgis.org/2019/11/06/add-google-maps-to-qgis-3/)

### From Excel to QGIS

- A __common workflow__ is to load data into QGIS from Excel tables. 

- With GIS you can show an excel table as a __geometric shape__ (points, lines or polygons).
- You can use __any kind of source__ to create data to load into GIS, you just have to put them in an Excel table first. 
- You can also __export data__ from GIS into Excel. 
- Excel tables have to be __cleaned and formatted__ in a specific way before being loaded into GIS.

```{Tip}
Exercise: Load data from Excel into QGIS
```

- In your “GIS_Training” folder, create a __subfolder__ called __“Datasets”__
- From [Sharepoint](https://login.microsoftonline.com/fedc3cba-ca5e-4388-a837-b45c7f0d71b7/oauth2/authorize?client%5Fid=00000003%2D0000%2D0ff1%2Dce00%2D000000000000&response%5Fmode=form%5Fpost&response%5Ftype=code%20id%5Ftoken&resource=00000003%2D0000%2D0ff1%2Dce00%2D000000000000&scope=openid&nonce=ED0D772DCEECB76021BB15ED5856C5F59BFC5642C932A149%2D3D7ED0B8676E60FBE34CDE3B11CF28C9FDD6B4F5AC08BB30CC2023750C2C7D90&redirect%5Furi=https%3A%2F%2Fbrcsbrms%2Esharepoint%2Ecom%2F%5Fforms%2Fdefault%2Easpx&state=OD0w&claims=%7B%22id%5Ftoken%22%3A%7B%22xms%5Fcc%22%3A%7B%22values%22%3A%5B%22CP1%22%5D%7D%7D%7D&wsucxt=1&cobrandid=11bd8083%2D87e0%2D41b5%2Dbb78%2D0bc43c8a8e8a&client%2Drequest%2Did=fd42dca0%2D7014%2D7000%2D4e1c%2Dd4890d840d5c&sso_reload=true) download the __ACLED_Nigeria_2022-2023__ file you will find in the there
- Open the file and then __save it as CSV__ (Comma Delimited) into the __“Datasets” folder__ you just created
- Now your data are ready to be loaded into QGIS

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Excel_data01](/fig/en_Excel_Data_a.png)

- Open your __“Session1”__ project
- From the menu, click on __Layer -> Add layer -> Add Delimited Text Layer…__

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Excel_data02](/fig/en_Excel_Data_b.png)

- Click on __…__ next to “File name” and browse for the __.csv file__ you saved in the Datasets folder
- Expand the __Geometry Definition__ section and select *longitude* for the __X field__ and *latitude* for the __Y field__
- In Geometry CRS, select Project CRS
- Click on __Add__, then __Close__
- Now let’s explore the map

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Excel_data03](/fig/en_Excel_Data_c.png)

- In the layers pane, __drag__ the newly created layer to the top of the layers list
- From the menu, select the __Identify feature tool__
- Click on any of the points in the map and have a look at the __feature attributes__ on the right pane

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Excel_data04](/fig/en_Excel_Data_d.png)

- Now __let’s export this layer into a Shapefile__
- In the layers pane, __right-click__ on the layer and select __Export -> Save feature as..__
- For “Format” choose __ESRI Shapefile__
- In “File name”, click on the three dots, browse to your Shapefiles folder and save the file as __NGA_SecurityIncidents__
- For “Geometry type”, choose __Point__
- Make sure that the “Add saved file to map” option is enabled, then click __Ok__
- Now right-click on the original layer and select __Remove layer__
- __Save__  your project

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Excel_data05](/fig/en_Excel_Data_e.png)

### The Attribute Table

- In GIS we can display a layer both as its geometric representation and as its __attribute table__ 

- The attribute table __displays information__ contained in a selected layer

- __Each row__ in the table __represents a feature__ 

- __Each column__ contains __a particular piece of information__ about the feature 

- Features in the table can be __searched, selected, moved or even edited__

```{Tip} 
Exercise: Open and explore the Attribute Table
```
- In the Layers pane, right-click on the NGA_Security Incidents layer and select __“Open Attribute Table”__
- Explore the Attribute Table. As you can see, __it looks like any table in Excel__. Infact, it looks exactly like the Excel file you originally used to create this layer
- From the top menu of the Attribute Table, click on __“Dock Attribute Table”__

## Installation QGIS

QGIS is open source and therefore freely available to everyone at no cost. You can install QGIS for Windows, Mac and Linux computers. __The actual Long Term Release is QGIS 3.28.11 Firenze__. Generally we recommend to use the __latest Long Term Release__, because it is the most stable and contains the fewest bugs. You can __download__ the latest version here: [https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html)

For our introduction, the standalone installers from OSGeo4W packages are sufficient for Windows.

### 32 Bit or 64 Bit?

For Windows operating systems, there is always a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version of each QGIS version available for download. __Which version to install depends on your computer and operating system__. If it is not clear how many bits your operating system has, you can easily find out: Left-click on the Windows icon at the bottom left of the screen (alternatively, open the Windows search function). Type "System" on the keyboard, click on the entry "System" in the search results. Under the item "System type" you can read the bit number.

Steps:

- __Open QGIS__ and familiarize yourself with the user interface
- __Open the above files__ in QGIS. Load the __vector layers__ into your programme Load the __CSV file__ via __"Add delimited text"__
- __Interact with the map and explore the data sets__. Use the zoom tool and move the map. Notice the status bar at the bottom of the screen and how it changes.
- Familiarize yourself with the __layer window (Layer List)__. Alternately show and hide different layers and move the layers in the hierarchy. __Rename the data layer__ in a meaningful way. Note that the latter has no effect on the data sources (file names, storage location).
- View the __attribute data__ of the layers. For this purpose look at the attribute table
- Changes the projection in the map view to __WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator - EPSG:3857__. Note that this does not change the projection (the coordinates) of the files, but only affects the projection of the map view.  Check this in the properties of the point layer. __Which projection is indicated there?__

 ``` {Tip}
 You can use the search bar on the top
 ```
- Now __save the health layer__ in the projection __WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator - EPSG:3857__. This changes the projection of the file. Check this in the properties of the newly created layer.
- __Save your project__
- __Optional:__ You can add the __OpenStreetMap base map__ via the browser windos -> XYZ Tiles. Note that online base maps can lead to problems with the projection of the different layers. Make sure to remove the base map bevor saving the project.

### Interface:

#### Overview

![Alt text](/fig/en_Interface_01.png)

- The __layers list__ shows __all layers/files__ that are __loaded in the project__. You can show/hide layers and set other properties.

- __Toolbars are shortcuts__ to execute frequently used commands. For example, there are special toolbars for __vector and raster files__, but also general ones for saving your project, etc. The toolbar contains, among other things, a list of all the commands you can use. The toolbar also contains the __toolbox__, which is used later in many of the wiki videos.

 <tagName>  <tagName>

![Alt text](/fig/en_Interface_02.png)

- The __map view__ is the __central component__ of every GIS programme. This is where the __geodata__ are displayed. The map view has a projection which does not always have to correspond to the projection of the layers.

- You can set the projection of the map view and the scale. You can read the coordinates of the mouse pointer and thus quickly find out the coordinates of points on the map. You can rotate your map view, e.g. if you want to create a map facing south.

- __Side Toolbar__. You may see a side toolbar. This is another way to easily open vector and raster files in QGIS.

- __Locator bar__. Here you can search for tools and layers. If you don't know where to find a tool, you can try here.

  - Open project

<video width="80%" controls src="https://gitlab.gistools.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/giscience/disaster-tools/gis-in-anticipatory-humanitarian-action/-/wikis/uploads/1655b97b741749bfa46c6c08ee3d0be6/qgis_open_project.mp4"></video>

 ``` {Tip}
 The layer data used in the project is not saved in the project file
 ```
Instead, the project file only contains the file paths where the layer data were located at the time the project was last saved on the PC. If the location of this layer data is subsequently changed, the error message "handle unavailable layers" will appear when the project is opened again.
Good data organisation with a fixed and well thought-out folder structure prevents such problems.

 - Show and hide displays

<video width="80%" controls src="https://gitlab.gistools.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/giscience/disaster-tools/gis-in-anticipatory-humanitarian-action/-/wikis/uploads/b9ccebc4bd584fdbc5092b4804d8a742/Anzeigen_einblenden_ausblenden.mp4"></video>

   - Move and arrange toolbars

 <video width="80%" controls src="https://gitlab.gistools.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/giscience/disaster-tools/gis-in-anticipatory-humanitarian-action/-/wikis/uploads/07bbf031499eb8da30daaa3bebd24769/qgis_arrange_toolbars.mp4"></video> 
  
  At each toolbar there is a field of two dotted lines. If you move the mouse pointer over it until an arrow cross appears and then hold down the left mouse button, you can move the toolbar. This allows an individualised arrangement of your own tools. By compressing all toolbars into a few lines, the map view window can also be enlarged.
