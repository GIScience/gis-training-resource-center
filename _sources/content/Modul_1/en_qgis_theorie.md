## General Information: 

- A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a __digital system that connects data to maps__.

- Geoinformatics in general focus on the __visualisation, organisation and processing of spatial data__. 

- Spatial analyses furthermore allow __to reveal circumstances and connections between spatial data features__: 

  - by making use of their spatial location, __information layers__ (or features within a layer) can be analyzed in regard to each other to obtain new information. 

## Why are Spatial Analyses important?

> **Discuss in groups**  
- Situations in which you benefitted from spatial analyses.
- Situations in which you could may be have benefitted from spatial analyses.
- Main areas where you see potential for spatial analyses in your work.


## Introduction to GIS: 

### We use GIS for:

 - Creating interactive queries __(Querying)__
 - Analysing spatial information __(Spatial analysis)__
 - Editing and visualizing data in maps __(Editing)__
 - Present the results of all these operations __(Map making)__

### GIS in Humanitarian Responses

GIS has many applications in the __humanitarian field__:

 - Refugee/IDP camp planning
 - Mapping remote areas to facilitate access
 - Keep track of field operations
 - Support security decisions
 - Support operations planning
 - Identify areas most affected by disasters

## A Galaxy of Tools
GIS comes with a __galaxy of tools__ that are constantly evolving. An increasing number of traditional tools are now capable of supporting geographic information (Excel, Power BI, Adobe Illustrator…)

### An Overview: 

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile Data Collection Tools |The latter make it possible to collect data via mobile or tablet, and often to visualize and exchange it with other platforms according to a common format.|
| Mapping Tools | These tools provide a simple vizualisation of geographic data, and allow for the production of maps.|
|GIS Tools| As opposed to the previous ones, these more advanced tools are very comprehensive and allow for advanced analyses to be carried out on the geographical components of data.|
| Webmapping Tools|These tools make it possible to manipulate and create maps online in a very simple way directly in a web browser. |


 ## Paper Maps and Cartography 

### What is Spatial Analysis?

- Spatial analysis __studies entities and events__ using their topological, geometric, or geographic properties. 
- It includes a __variety of techniques__ to analyse geographic data. 
- Data can be __added to a map as layers and they can interact with each other__. 
- GIS enables you to work with these __layers__ to explore critically important questions and __find answers__ to those questions.

> **An Example from the Past: John Snows' Cholera Map**  

In 1854 an __outbreak of cholera__ occurred in London, England. The most common theory was that the disease was spread through the air. Dr.John Snow believed that the danger was __in the water__. He made a map to analyse the __number of deaths__ in Soho per house block. He added the __location of water pumps__ on the map.
He found a __correlation__ between one specific water pump and the number of infections.

__Dr. Snow's map of the Cholera outbreak of 1854__, and the reports that it accompanied, __won over the predominant "Miasma Theory"__ that the disease __was spread through the air__. Residents were now warned to __boil their water__, and so ended the last Cholera outbreak London has seen.

__Using GIS__, several measures of spatial central tendency have been applied to the dataset, revealing that the Spatial Mean (the geographic center of the distribution of deaths) of the outbreak lies __within 35 meters of the Broad Street Pump__, identified as the __source of contamination__ in the 1854 outbreak.

## GIS vs Cartography

- __Cartography__ is the study and practice of __making maps__.
- A GIS is a __modern extension__ of traditional cartography. 
- Both contain examples of a __base map__ to which additional data can be added. 
- The differences are that there is no limit to the __amount of additional data__ that can be added to a GIS map. 
- Cartographic maps are often extremely simplified as there are limits to the amount of data that can be physically and meaningfully stored on a small map. 
- GIS uses __analysis and statistics__ to present data in support of particular arguments which a cartographic map cannot do. 
- You can use GIS __for__ cartography.

### General Reference Maps

-  Show important __physical features__ of an area
-  Include __natural and man-made features__
-  Usually meant to help for __navigation__ or discovery of locations
-  Usually fairly __simple__
-  Can be __stylized__ based on the intended audience

### Infrastructure Maps

 - Display relevant features and __structures__ in a specific area
 - Help __planning__ and navigation
 - High level of __detail__
 - Produced after field __data collection__

### Thematic Maps

  - Focus on a __specific theme__ or subject
  - Features on the map __represent the subject__ being mapped
  - Use __colours and shapes__ to display quantitative and qualitative data
  - Rise __awareness__ about a specific subject

### Analysis Maps

  - __Analyse data__ in respect to their geographic location
  - Create __new layers of information__ from the interaction between multiple features
  - Use colours and shapes __to help users__ understand specific events
  - __Support__ decision makers
  - Generally display a greater __level of detail__
