# Graphical Variables and Symbology

The representation of geodata in maps is crucial in order to provide useful location-based insights. This subchapter will cover the basics of good map design, how to create a map design in QGIS as well as common mistakes when designing or interpreting maps.

## Types of maps
>remove probably

In general, there are two main types of maps: __topographic maps__ and __thematic maps__.

__Topographic maps__ are intended to be exhaustive, including elements fundamental to localisation (localities, road networks, terrain, hydrography). They represent the physical location of objects in the real world. The representation of elements in topographic maps is done via conventional signs (e.g.: blue for water, green for forests, yellow for agricultural land).

```


__Thematic maps__ adress the distribution of phenomena, including sometimes statistically processed information, such as population size, disease cases, flooding risk, etc. The representation of elements on thematic maps is decided according to the rules of graphic semiology.

## Graphic Semiology

__Definition__: A set of rules allowing the use of a __graphic sign systems__ to convey information. Graphic semiology uses visual variables to construct a system of signs, allowing the graphic translation of information.

Our brain is capable of interpreting graphic relationships between entities in just seconds. Semiology attempts to theorise these interpretation to make the map more effective and relevant.

Depending on the type of information you want to display, you can use different graphic signs
```


### Visual variables

Visual variables are the __graphical means for visually transcribing information__. The visual variables are __shape, size, hue, value, texture, and orientation__. You can vary these variables to appropriately represent the data at your disposal.  
It allows for the expression of __relationship of difference, order, association, or quantity__ between each element.

Visual perception varies from one person to the next according to various capabilities:
- Physiological (e.g.: colour blindness)
- Transcultural (green = nature, blue = water)

# Symbology and styling

Depending on the use case and type of geodata at your disposal, there are multiple ways to visualise geodata in a comprehensive format:

- You can change the 'styling' and color of the data
- You can add textlabels 
- Vector and raster data is visualized differently in GIS-Software. 


## Styling Panel

Styling panel in QGIS 3.30.2
```

For each layer in QGIS, there is a styling panel where you can change the symbology, colour and label for the features in that layer. There are two ways to open the layer styling options in QGIS:  
1. Right click on the layer you wish to style and select properties
2. Open the layer styling panel by enabling it under "View">"Panels">"Layer Styling"

~~In the styling panel, you can change the symbology (1) and the labels (2).~~


## Symbology

- Symbology is used to change the look of features on a map
- It makes maps more visually appealing and easier to read
- Colors and styles represent a specific information
- Symbology is applied to layers, but within the same layer we can assign multiple styles to features
- the symbology of a layer can be __changed based on one of its attributes__

## Colours

Colours are arguably the most striking visual variables as they are easily disinguishable. However, depending on the type of data and the information you wish to convey, there are a few things to consider when choosing a colour scheme for your map. The most important variables for colours are the __hue__ and the __value__ (saturation, transparency). 
> look for correct words  

Colours schemes can be __categorial, sequential, or diverging__. If you wish to display different types of buildings or roads, the colour schemes should be categorial. Colour gradients, either sequential or diverging, are used for numerical data or data that can be ordered. For example, for the population sizes of districts a sequential colouring schemes is best to show the relative difference between the values. However, if the data has positive __and__ negative values, a diverging colour gradient should be used.

```

When choosing colour gradients, a clear gradient from lighter to darker colours is the best most of the times as the gradation is easily distinguishable and translates well into black and white. In the figure below, example A) and B) are not ideal as it is difficult to make out the gradation and it does not translate into black and white. You can achieve a clear sequence by grading the __saturation__ of the colour gradient.

Examples for different colour gradients translated into black and white. Pay attention to the saturation gradient
```

Colour gradients can also encompass several hues

```


### Colour Blindness

When choosing the colours, you have to keep in mind that colour gradients (especially diverging Red-Green gradients) can be hard or impossible to distinguish for persons with colour blindness.

```


## Symbology for Vector data

You can use graphical variables to style vector data. As we have already learned, vector data can be either points, lines, or polygons. There are different options to symbolize these different types of vector data.

```

### Symbology for points

For point data, you can 

### Symbology for lines

### Symbology for polygons

## Symbology for raster data

As we have already learned, raster data are basically a grid of pixels with different (numerical) values. As such, you can't style the shape, fill or outline of raster data. It is only possible to assign colours to the different values of the pixels.

### Assigning a colour gradient to raster data

To assign a colour gradient for raster data, you need to:

1. Open the styling panel for the raster layer
2. Navigate to the Symbology tab  
3. By default, the colour scheme is set to Singleband gray (if you only have one colour band in the data set). Click on __Singleband gray__ and switch to __Singleband pseudocolour__
4. Click on the arrow to the right of the colour ramp. Here you can choose a premade colour ramp
5. You can modify the colour ramp by clicking on the colour ramp itself

Colour Ramp Selector
```

In the colour ramp selector, you can adjust each colour step. On the bottom, you can see a plot for the Hue, __Saturation__, __Lightness__ and __Opacity__. Especially latter three are useful to see how your colour ramp will translate.

## Labels

- Labels are text that show a specific attribute of features. 
- It is useful to add labels to features to easily identify them. For example, the name of a settlement.
- You can change the font, colour and size of labels
- When you create a map you always add labels to help the final user reading the map

#### Adding labels to a layer
>This is exercise 2 in the PPP

1. In the styling panel, click on the "Labels" tab.
2. Select *Single Labels*. 
3. "Value" is where you choose the attribute that will be displayed as a label. For example "NAME". This will display the "NAME" attribute for each feature. In the example (figure X), *ADM1_EN* will display the English names of Nigerian states.
>change figure number
4. Let's change the font: make it Arial, bold, dark grey, 8 pt
5. Let's add a white buffer around the label.
7. Click Apply and Ok.

```

#### Adding 2 different label styles to the same layer
>This is exercise 3 in PPP

Sometimes you will need to create two different label styles for different features of a single layer. In this example, we will create one label style for the *Country Capital*, and another one for the *State Capitals*

1. Open the styling panel and click on the Labels tab
2. Select __Rule-based Labeling__
3. Click on the __Add Rule__ button at the bottom (the "+"-sign) and create the first rule
4. For __Value__, select __"NAME"__ (so that the labels will show the name of each city), then click on the "ε"-button next to the "Filter" bar.

To add rule-based labels, you need to enter an expression
```

5. In the central column, expand ==__Fields and Values__== to display a list of all the fields in your layer and double-click on _Class__ to add it to the expression frame on the left.
6. In the right column, click on __All unique__ to list all unique values contained in the Class field
7. Click on the "`=`" operator, then doube-click on the _value 1_ (which represent the Country capital in this case). Click OK.
8. Scroll down to *change the label style*. Make it Arial, bold, black, 12pt and add a white buffer.
9. Repeat steps 4 to 9, but select *Value 2* (State capitals) and make the label black, bold, 10pt, no buffer.
10. Click **Apply**, the OK.
