# Representation

The representation of geodata in maps is crucial in order to provide useful location-based insights. This subchapter will cover the basics of good map design, how to create a map design in QGIS as well as common mistakes when designing or interpreting maps.

## Types of maps

In general, there are two main types of maps: __topographic maps__ and __thematic maps__.

__Topographic maps__ are intended to be exhaustive, including elements fundamental to localisation (localities, road networks, terrain, hydrography). They represent the physical location of objects in the real world. The representation of elements in topographic maps is done via conventional signs (e.g.: blue for water, green for forests, yellow for agricultural land).

__Thematic maps__ adress the distribution of phenomena, including sometimes statistically processed information, such as population size, disease cases, flooding risk, etc. The representation of elements on thematic maps is decided according to the rules of graphic semiology.

## Graphic Semiology

__Definition__: A set of rules allowing the use of a __graphic sign systems__ to convey information

Our brain is capable of interpreting graphic relationships between entities in just seconds. Semiology attempts to theorise these interpretation to make the map more effective and relevant.

Depending on the type of information you want to display, you can use different graphic signs
```



### Visual variables

__visual variables are the graphical means for visually transcribing information. 

__BUT__ visual perception varies from one person to the next according to various capabilities:
- Physiological (e.g.: colour blindness)
- Transcultural (green = nature, blue = water)

## Symbology and styling

Depending on the use case and type of geodata at your disposal, there are multiple ways to visualise geodata in a comprehensive format:

- You can change the 'styling' and color of the data
- You can add textlabels 
- Vector and raster data is visualized differently in GIS-Software. 


## Styling Panel

name: styling panel

Styling panel in QGIS 3.30.2
```

For each layer in QGIS, there is a styling panel where you can change the symbology, colour and label for the features in that layer. There are two ways to open the layer styling options in QGIS:  
1. Right click on the layer you wish to style and select properties
2. Open the layer styling panel by enabling it under "View">"Panels">"Layer Styling"

In the styling panel, you can change the symbology (1) and the labels (2).

### Styling of vector data

### Styling of raster data

### Labels

- Labels are text that show a specific attribute of features. 
- It is useful to add labels to features to easily identify them. For example, the name of a settlement.
- You can change the font, colour and size of labels
- When you create a map you always add labels to help the final user reading the map

**Add labels to a layer**
>This is exercise 2 in the PPP

1. In the styling panel, click on the "Labels" tab
2. Select *Single Labels* 
3. "Value" is where you choose the attribute that will be displayed as a label. For example "NAME". This will display the "NAME" attribute for each feature.


# Print layout

In order to export a PDF of the map, you need to create a print layout. QGIS project is not a map until the layout elements (legend, title, scale bar, etc.) are added. 


1. Go to __Project > New Print Layout > enter a name for the new print layout > click OK__
2. A new window witha blank print playout will appear.

The interface of the Print Layout Composer
```

1. __Layout Settings__ (Add pages, Export Map, manage panels)
2. __Dialer Tools__ (Save, New, Duplicate, Add items from template, Save template)
3.  __Navigation bar__ (Zoom, Refresh, Lock/Unlock elements)
4. __Toolbar__ (Zoom, Select, Move in Map, Add new map/image/text/legend/scale/shape/...)
5. __Feature Panel__: displays the elements added to the print layout
6. __Advanced Options__: customize each element of the layer

First of all, you should always set the size of your map:

- Right-click on the blank map > Page Properties
- Choose __the size of your document__ (A4, A3, A2)
- Choose the orientation (Landscape or Portrait)

_A4 and A3 are the most commonly used sizes for maps_

## Adding elements to the print layout

### Add a new map

- Add a new map by clicking on the __Add map__ button on the __toolbar on the left__ and __drag a rectangle on the map canvas.  
- To move the map on the canvas, simply __select the map__ and __drag__ it with your mouse
- To move within a map select __Move item content__ button on the 
- To zoom in on the map, while using the __Move item content__ button, you can __Press CTRL + scroll the mouse wheel__ (gently) or enter the scale manually in the item properties

### Add a text box

- To add text (title, explanations), use the __Add Label__ tool and draw a rectangle of the desired size.
- In the __Item Properties__ panel (on the right of your screen) you can __enter your text__ and __change the font, style, colour, etc.__ (_Remember to use the scroll bar in the window to see all the options).

```

### Add a legend

Before adding a legend, make sure that:

- All your layers have an explicit name ("rivers", "primary roads",...)
- You use the final version of your map (no more layers to add, move, rename or modify). You can still modify them later but you will have to redo the legend.

To add a legend, you can use the __add legend__ button on the __left toolbar__.


```{figure} ../../fig/en_30.30.2_print_layout_add_legend.png
---
width: 500px
name: Add a legend to the print layout
---
Adding a legend to the print layout
```

In the __item properties__ panel, if you keep the __'Auto update'__ option checked, new layers added to your project will automatically be added to the legend but you cannot control them individually (rename if necessary, reorder ot remove items).  
Once the option is unchecked, you can update the name of the layers, group them, reorganise them, etc.

### Add a scale bar

Before adding a scale bar, select your main map and check in the __Item Properties__ panel that the __Scale__ fielld has a __round number__ 


```{figure} ../../fig/en_30.30.2_print_layout_scale.png
---
width: 500px
name: Round number for scale
---
Make sure that the scale is at a round number
```

To add a scale bar, you can use the __add scale bar__ button on the __left toolbar__. In the __Item Properties__ panel, customize the following functions

- Which Map __is related to the scale__
- __Unit system of the bar__ (metres, miles, degrees)
- __Segments on the left__: segments shown before 0 m (always set to 0). 
- __Fixed width__: define the width of each segment (e.g. 1 km, 10 km, 50 km, ...). 
- __Height__: height (thickness) of the scale bar

_There are many other options to customize the scale bar (change the font, colours, etc.)._ 

```{figure} ../../fig/en_30.30.2_print_layout_add_scale_bar.png

width: 500px
name: Add scale bar
---
Add and customize the scale bar
```

### Adding an overview map

Adding an overview map in the corner of your map will help locate the area you are viewing on the main map.

To create an overview map, you need to follow these steps:

1. Prepare a __layer with national or subnational borders or important landmarks__ in your project (e.g: Administrative boundaries, Capitals)
2. __Insert the overview map__ into your print layout (in the bottom right corner for example)
3.  __Lock the new map__ in the Item properties panel
4. Add a rectangle to display the extent of your main map

    1. Go to the __properties__ of your Main map > scroll down until you see __"Overviews"__ 
    2. Add an Overview by clicking on the __"+" icon__
    3. __Link the main map__ by selecting it in the __"Map frame"__ option

---
width: 500px
name: Create an Overview
---
Add a the extent of the main map to your overview map (the red rectangle on the overview)
```

``` {note} Caution
This method requires you to be sure that you are not going to modify the oveview map, as once the layers are locked, they will keep the style, and any updates will not affect the overview map
```


## Good practices and common mistakes in mapping

In order to produce good maps, there are some __basic rules__ to follow and common __semiological mistakes__ to avoid. 

### Map composition

#### Key elements of a map

A map is never complete without the following elements: 
- Title
- Legend
- Scale
- Orientation
- Source
- Localization (Overview) Map
- Author

> Image?

----

__The title__ summarizes in a few words the information represented on the map, giving the reader useful contextual information. Titles should include the following information:

- __The place__, with several degrees of precision according to the scale (Country, Region, Township,...)
- __The subject__ intelligible by all (make sure that the acronyms used are detailed elsewhere on the map)
- __the date__ of the represented data

_Examples:_ 

- _"Access to health care in Maputo, Mozambique in 2022"_
- _"Flooding Risk in Ghardaia, Algeria"_

__The legend__ is key to interpreting the information represented on the map. Without it, it is impossible to understand the meaning of the different symbols and colours used map. In order to guide the reader, the legend must be:

- __Comprehensive__: All the data on the map must be presented in the legend.
- __Representative__: the figures on the map and in the legend must match (same size, same color, ...).
- __Organized__: the data in the legend can be grouped by thematic categories (health, environment, background map, ...) or by type of figure (point, line, surface) to facilitate reading.

__The scale bar__ is essential to a map since it gives the correspondence between a distance measured on the map and the distance in the real world. There are two types of scales:
- __The numerical Scale__ is expressed as a fraction (1/25000 or 1:25000) which indicates the equivalence between 1 centimeter on the map and the real distance. It is a scale that can be calculated with GIS software, and is often found in topographic maps
    - A scale of 1:25000 means that 1 cm represents 25000 cm (or 250 meters) on the gound. 

- __the graphical scale__ is expressed by a line on the map, with an associated distance value. This scale is very useful to have an idea of the distances on the ground. The graphical scale will always be the correct size, even if a different printing format is used, since it will undergo the same transformation as the rest of the map

__Orientation__

Even if by default the majority of the maps are oriented to the North, it is still necessary to specify the orientation of the map. It is often indicated by an arrow to the North. Sometimes the orientation of different in order to optimize the representation of the study area on the map.

### Sources

Any data represented on a map should have its sources indicated. This provides a record of the data used, but also references the author of the data. The reader will then be able to look for more information on the sources if he wishes. Open access geographic data, such as OpenStreetMap, are more and more numerous and must also be cited on the maps.  

It is possible to give the source of each data under the legend, or to do it in a dedicated space in the map. The level of precision of the sources varies according to the author or the precision of the data.


### The 4 semiological errors

#### 1. Proportional circles vs. solid colors

```{caution}
DO NOT represent __quantitative__ stock character/data with a solid color
```

This is one of the most common mistakes in mapping. While this representation is graphically appealing, it is still false and distracts from the message of the map.

It is a mistake because:

- You lose the __order relationship between the data__ (a circle can be twice as big as another one, a color cannot be "twice as dark")
- Countries with a large surface area stand out visually (eg.: Russia in the example below)
- We are trying to represent __data that has nothing to do with the area of a country__, but rather speaks of individual elements
