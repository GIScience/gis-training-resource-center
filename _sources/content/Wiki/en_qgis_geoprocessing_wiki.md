## Buffer
- Calculate a ![](/fig/mAlgorithmBuffer.png) `buffer` with a defined distance.
- Dissolve: if 2 or more buffer areas overlap, they can be combined.

```{Attention}
The unit of distance depends on the projection of the layer. For buffering you usually need a __metric coordinate system__ such as UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator).
```

```{Hint}
If you're dealing with really large "megabuffers" or if you can only choose buffer distances in degrees instead of meters, it might mean there's __no metric coordinate system__, or it was __incorrectly reprojected__. The unit of the buffer __depends__ on the __coordinate reference systems of the layer__.
```

## Clip
- With the ![](/fig/mAlgorithmClip.png) `Clip` tool you can extract and retain the spatial extent of one vector layer based on the boundaries of another layer. 
- `Input Layer`: refers to the specific __layer to be clipped__, for instance, a road network.
- `Overlay Layer`: e.g. a polygon layer of the region (e.g. borders of Heidelberg).

## Dissolve
- The ![](/fig/mAlgorithmDissolve.png) `dissolve` tool aggregates geometries with the same attribute values.
- When 2 or more buffer areas overlap, they can be combined using dissolve.

```{Attention}
In QGIS, only the attributes selected for the dissolve operation will receive the accurate attribute, while the remaining attributes remain unaggregated; hence, in this example, the name is not accurately represented (e.g. the name for Western Europe might be mistakenly assigned as "Netherlands").
```

## Intersection

The ![](/fig/intersection_icon.png) `intersection` tool extracts the part of layers which overlap.

1. Click `Vector` -> `Geoprocessing Tool` -> `Intersection` OR `Toolbox` -> Search for `Intersection`
2. `Input layer`: select layer one 
3. `Overlay layer`: select layer two
4. `Intersection`: Specify where you want to save the results and give it a good name 

```{Note}
* Order of input layer and overlay layer does not matter here
* Possibility to keep only certain fields of the output layer
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: Attribute values that refer to output areas (e.g. population) are no longer meaningful after the intersect

```
