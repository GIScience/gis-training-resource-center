# Raster

__ðŸ”™[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__

Raster data in GIS is a type of spatial data that represents the world as a grid of pixels (cells), where each pixel has a value representing information such as:

- Elevation
- Temperature
- Land cover type
- Satellite imagery

Each cell has a fixed size (e.g., 10x10 meters), and the data is often stored in formats like GeoTIFF, IMG, or ASCII Grid.

Raster data is best for continuous data (like elevation or rainfall), and itâ€™s commonly used in remote sensing, environmental modeling, and image analysis.

In contrast, vector data represents features as points, lines, or polygons.
