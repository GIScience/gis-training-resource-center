# Joining Geodata (Spatial and non-spatial joins)

__ðŸ”™[Back to Homepage](/content/intro.md)__


In GIS, joins combine data from two tables based on a common field (non-spatial join) or based on location/geometry (spatial join).
Spatial joins link attributes based on geographic relationships (like intersection or proximity), while non-spatial joins rely on matching attribute values (like IDs).
