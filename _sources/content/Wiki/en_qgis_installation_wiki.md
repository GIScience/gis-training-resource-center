# QGIS installation 
QGIS is open source and therefore freely available to everyone at no cost. You can install QGIS for Windows, Mac and Linux computers. In the course we use QGIS 3.22.15 Białowieża (LTR). Generally, we recommend using the latest Long Term Release, because it is the most stable and contains the fewest bugs.
You can download the latest version here:

For our introduction, the standalone installers from OSGeo4W packages are sufficient for Windows.

**32 Bit or 64 Bit?**

For Windows operating systems, there is always a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version of each QGIS version available for download. Which version to install depends on your computer and operating system.
If it is not clear how many bits your operating system has, you can easily find out:

Left-click on the Windows icon at the bottom left of the screen (alternatively, open the Windows search function).
Type "System" on the keyboard
Click on the entry "System" in the search results.
Under the item "System type" you can read the bit number.
