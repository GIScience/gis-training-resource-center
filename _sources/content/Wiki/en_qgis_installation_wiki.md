# QGIS installation 
QGIS is open source and therefore freely available to everyone at no cost. You can install QGIS for Windows, Mac and Linux computers.

Generally, we recommend using the latest Long Term Release, because it is the most stable and contains the fewest bugs.

You can download the latest version here:

1. Go to the [__QGIS download page__](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).
2. Select `Download for Windows`, `Download for macOS` or `Dowload for Linux`, depending on your system.
3. Click on `Looking for the most stable version? Get QGIS 3.28 LTR`


## Windows specialities

### 32 Bit or 64 Bit?
For __Windows operating systems__, there is always a 32-bit version and a 64-bit version of each QGIS version available for download. Which version to install depends on your computer and operating system. If it is not clear how many bits your operating system has, you can easily find out: Left-click on the __Windows icon at__ the bottom left of the screen (alternatively, open the Windows search function). Type __"System"__ on the keyboard, click on the entry __"System"__ in the search results. Under the item __"System type"__ you can read the bit number.

```{Note} 
Since QGIS 3.20 there are only 64-bit Windows executables.
```

## Mac specialities


```{Note} 
From version 3.30 SAGA must be integrated via plugin.
```

## Linux specialities

```{Note} 
From version 3.30 SAGA must be integrated via plugin.
```

For installation on Linux systems with apt you can install QGIS:

```
sudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass
```

If you install a QGIS version 3.30 or higher you have to install the plugin _Processing Saga NextGen Provider_ .
